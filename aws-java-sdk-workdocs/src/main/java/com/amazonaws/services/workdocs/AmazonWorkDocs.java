/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon WorkDocs.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.workdocs.AbstractAmazonWorkDocs} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * File Migration: File migration applications are supported for users who want to migrate their files from an
 * on-premises or off-premises file system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory structure, as well
 * as allow for basic metadata changes, such as modifications to the permissions of files.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have additional security needs, such as antivirus
 * or data loss prevention. The API actions, along with AWS CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when changes
 * occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary actions and replace the target file. If the
 * target file violates the policy, the application can also choose to email the user.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics. These
 * applications can choose to mimic or record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with AWS CloudTrail, to
 * replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical applications.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the
 * AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission
 * policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full
 * administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is
 * not limited to, the ability to modify file permissions and upload any file to any user. This allows developers to
 * perform the three use cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the
 * IAM model.
 * </p>
