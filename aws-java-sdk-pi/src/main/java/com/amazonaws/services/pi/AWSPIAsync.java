/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS PI asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object representing
 * the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive notification when
 * an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.pi.AbstractAWSPIAsync} instead.

 * <fullname>Amazon RDS Performance Insights</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different dimensions of database load based on
 * data captured from a running DB instance. The guide provides detailed information about Performance Insights data
 * types, parameters and errors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the
 * performance of your DB instance. Amazon CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for AWS service-vended
 * monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of DB load.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * DB load is measured as Average Active Sessions. Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a
 * two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time
 * range. Each time point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured at that time point.
 * Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.
 * </p>
