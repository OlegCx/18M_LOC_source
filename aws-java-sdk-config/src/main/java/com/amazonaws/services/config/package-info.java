/**
 * <fullname>AWS Config</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the AWS resources associated with your AWS
 * account. You can use AWS Config to get the current and historical configurations of each AWS resource and also to get
 * information about the relationship between the resources. An AWS resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
 * instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a
 * complete list of resources currently supported by AWS Config, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html#supported-resources"
 * >Supported AWS Resources</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can access and manage AWS Config through the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI),
 * the AWS Config API, or the AWS SDKs for AWS Config. This reference guide contains documentation for the AWS Config
 * API and the AWS CLI commands that you can use to manage AWS Config. The AWS Config API uses the Signature Version 4
 * protocol for signing requests. For more information about how to sign a request with this protocol, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing
 * Process</a>. For detailed information about AWS Config features and their associated actions or commands, as well as
 * how to work with AWS Management Console, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html">What Is AWS Config</a> in the
 * <i>AWS Config Developer Guide</i>.
