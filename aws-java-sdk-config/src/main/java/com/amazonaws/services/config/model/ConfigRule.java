/**
 * <p>
 * An AWS Config rule represents an AWS Lambda function that you create for a custom rule or a predefined function for
 * an AWS managed rule. The function evaluates configuration items to assess whether your AWS resources comply with your
 * desired configurations. This function can run when AWS Config detects a configuration change to an AWS resource and
 * at a periodic frequency that you choose (for example, every 24 hours).
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS CLI and AWS SDKs if you want to create a rule that triggers evaluations for your resources when
 * AWS Config delivers the configuration snapshot. For more information, see <a>ConfigSnapshotDeliveryProperties</a>.
