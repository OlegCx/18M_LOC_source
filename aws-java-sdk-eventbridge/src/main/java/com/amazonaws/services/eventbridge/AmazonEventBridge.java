/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon EventBridge.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.eventbridge.AbstractAmazonEventBridge} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change state,
 * they automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream
 * and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For
 * example, you can configure rules to:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance
 * enters the running state.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential
 * security or availability risks.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For more information about the features of Amazon EventBridge, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide">Amazon EventBridge User Guide</a>.

     * on a schedule.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you
     * organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user
     * permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the <code>PutRule</code> operation and
     * assign tags, you must have both the <code>events:PutRule</code> and <code>events:TagResource</code> permissions.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the <code>PutRule</code> operation are ignored. To
     * update the tags of an existing rule, use <a>TagResource</a> and <a>UntagResource</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge
     * uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event
     * patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For
     * example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the
     * desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again,
     * creating an infinite loop.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your
     * rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which
     * alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/budgets-managing-costs.html">Managing Your
     * Costs with Budgets</a>.

     * To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) needs the

     * For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, AWS Step Functions state machines and API Gateway REST APIs, EventBridge
     * relies on IAM roles that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For more

     * <p>
     * If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using <code>PutPermission</code>),
     * you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To
     * send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when
     * you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for
     * each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event
     * is not charged. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/">Amazon

     * <p>
     * If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your

     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If none of the following arguments are specified for a target, then the entire event is passed to the target in
     * JSON format (unless the target is Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event
     * is passed to the target).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If <b>Input</b> is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event is overridden with this constant.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If <b>InputPath</b> is specified in the form of JSONPath (for example, <code>$.detail</code>), then only the part
     * of the event specified in the path is passed to the target (for example, only the detail part of the event is
     * passed).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If <b>InputTransformer</b> is specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and
     * used as values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
