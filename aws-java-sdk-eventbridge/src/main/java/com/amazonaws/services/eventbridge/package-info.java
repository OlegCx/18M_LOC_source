/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change state,
 * they automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream
 * and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For
 * example, you can configure rules to:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance
 * enters the running state.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential
 * security or availability risks.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
