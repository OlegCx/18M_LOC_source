/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Data Pipeline.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.datapipeline.AbstractDataPipeline} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Data Pipeline configures and manages a data-driven workflow called a pipeline. AWS Data Pipeline handles the
 * details of scheduling and ensuring that data dependencies are met so that your application can focus on processing
 * the data.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Data Pipeline provides a JAR implementation of a task runner called AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner. AWS Data
 * Pipeline Task Runner provides logic for common data management scenarios, such as performing database queries and
 * running data analysis using Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your
 * task runner, or you can write your own task runner to provide custom data management.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality. Use the first set to create a pipeline and define data
 * sources, schedules, dependencies, and the transforms to be performed on the data. Use the second set in your task
 * runner application to receive the next task ready for processing. The logic for performing the task, such as querying
 * the data, running data analysis, or converting the data from one format to another, is contained within the task
 * runner. The task runner performs the task assigned to it by the web service, reporting progress to the web service as
 * it does so. When the task is done, the task runner reports the final success or failure of the task to the web
 * service.
 * </p>
