/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS CodeStar Notifications.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.codestarnotifications.AbstractAWSCodeStarNotifications} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * This AWS CodeStar Notifications API Reference provides descriptions and usage examples of the operations and data
 * types for the AWS CodeStar Notifications API. You can use the AWS CodeStar Notifications API to work with the
 * following objects:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Notification rules, by calling the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>CreateNotificationRule</a>, which creates a notification rule for a resource in your account.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>DeleteNotificationRule</a>, which deletes a notification rule.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>DescribeNotificationRule</a>, which provides information about a notification rule.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>ListNotificationRules</a>, which lists the notification rules associated with your account.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>UpdateNotificationRule</a>, which changes the name, events, or targets associated with a notification rule.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>Subscribe</a>, which subscribes a target to a notification rule.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>Unsubscribe</a>, which removes a target from a notification rule.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Targets, by calling the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>DeleteTarget</a>, which removes a notification rule target (SNS topic) from a notification rule.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>ListTargets</a>, which lists the targets associated with a notification rule.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Events, by calling the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>ListEventTypes</a>, which lists the event types you can include in a notification rule.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Tags, by calling the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>ListTagsForResource</a>, which lists the tags already associated with a notification rule in your account.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>TagResource</a>, which associates a tag you provide with a notification rule in your account.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a>UntagResource</a>, which removes a tag from a notification rule in your account.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For information about how to use AWS CodeStar Notifications, see link in the CodeStarNotifications User Guide.
