     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Although you can customize the message headers when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, Amazon SES

     * If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you
     * to specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two
     * ways: you can pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>, <code>FromArn</code>, and/or
     * <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw
     * email:
     * </p>

     * <p>
     * This operation is more flexible than the <code>SendEmail</code> API operation. When you use the
     * <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, you can specify the headers of the message as well as its content. This

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and one of the recipient addresses isn't in a

     * rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are valid.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a

     * <important>
     * <p>
     * When you execute the <code>VerifyDomainDkim</code> operation, the domain that you specify is added to the list of
     * identities that are associated with your account. This is true even if you haven't already associated the domain
     * with your account by using the <code>VerifyDomainIdentity</code> operation. However, you can't send email from
     * the domain until you either successfully <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html">verify it</a> or you
     * successfully <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html">set up DKIM for
     * it</a>.
     * </p>
     * </important>
     * <p>
     * You use the tokens that are generated by this operation to create CNAME records. When Amazon SES detects that
     * you've added these records to the DNS configuration for a domain, you can start sending email from that domain.
     * You can start sending email even if you haven't added the TXT record provided by the VerifyDomainIdentity
     * operation to the DNS configuration for your domain. All email that you send from the domain is authenticated
     * using DKIM.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To create the CNAME records for DKIM authentication, use the following values:

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * In the preceding example, replace <i>token</i> with one of the tokens that are generated when you execute this
     * operation. Replace <i>example.com</i> with your domain. Repeat this process for each token that's generated by
     * this operation.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can execute this operation no more than once per second.
