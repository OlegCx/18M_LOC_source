     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Although you can customize the message headers when using the <code>SendRawEmail</code> operation, Amazon SES

     * headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, <code>SendRawEmail</code> enables you
     * to specify the cross-account identity for the email's Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two
     * ways: you can pass optional parameters <code>SourceArn</code>, <code>FromArn</code>, and/or
     * <code>ReturnPathArn</code> to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw
     * email:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>X-SES-SOURCE-ARN</code>
     * </p>

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email.
     * </p>
     * </important>
     * <p>

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In order to send email using the <code>SendTemplatedEmail</code> operation, your call to the API must meet the
     * following requirements:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The call must refer to an existing email template. You can create email templates using the <a>CreateTemplate</a>
     * operation.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The message must be sent from a verified email address or domain.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send to verified addresses or domains, or to
     * email addresses associated with the Amazon SES Mailbox Simulator. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-addresses-and-domains.html">Verifying Email
     * Addresses and Domains</a> in the <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide.</i>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The maximum message size is 10 MB.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Calls to the <code>SendTemplatedEmail</code> operation may only include one <code>Destination</code> parameter. A
     * destination is a set of recipients who will receive the same version of the email. The <code>Destination</code>
     * parameter can include up to 50 recipients, across the To:, CC: and BCC: fields.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The <code>Destination</code> parameter must include at least one recipient email address. The recipient address
     * can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC: address. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is
     * not in the format <i>UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain</i>), the entire message will be rejected, even
     * if the message contains other recipients that are valid.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <important>
     * <p>
     * If your call to the <code>SendTemplatedEmail</code> operation includes all of the required parameters, Amazon SES
     * accepts it and returns a Message ID. However, if Amazon SES can't render the email because the template contains
     * errors, it doesn't send the email. Additionally, because it already accepted the message, Amazon SES doesn't
     * return a message stating that it was unable to send the email.
     * </p>
