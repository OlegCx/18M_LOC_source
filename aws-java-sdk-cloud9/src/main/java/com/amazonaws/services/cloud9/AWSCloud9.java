 * Interface for accessing AWS Cloud9.

 * <p>
 * AWS Cloud9 is a collection of tools that you can use to code, build, run, test, debug, and release software in the
 * cloud.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about AWS Cloud9, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide">AWS

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Cloud9 supports these operations:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>CreateEnvironmentEC2</code>: Creates an AWS Cloud9 development environment, launches an Amazon EC2 instance,
 * and then connects from the instance to the environment.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>CreateEnvironmentMembership</code>: Adds an environment member to an environment.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>DeleteEnvironment</code>: Deletes an environment. If an Amazon EC2 instance is connected to the environment,
 * also terminates the instance.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>DeleteEnvironmentMembership</code>: Deletes an environment member from an environment.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>DescribeEnvironmentMemberships</code>: Gets information about environment members for an environment.

 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>ListTagsForResource</code>: Gets the tags for an environment.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>TagResource</code>: Adds tags to an environment.
