/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Pricing.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.pricing.AbstractAWSPricing} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Price List Service API (AWS Price List Service) is a centralized and convenient way to programmatically query
 * Amazon Web Services for services, products, and pricing information. The AWS Price List Service uses standardized
 * product attributes such as <code>Location</code>, <code>Storage Class</code>, and <code>Operating System</code>, and
 * provides prices at the SKU level. You can use the AWS Price List Service to build cost control and scenario planning
 * tools, reconcile billing data, forecast future spend for budgeting purposes, and provide cost benefit analysis that
 * compare your internal workloads with AWS.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use <code>GetServices</code> without a service code to retrieve the service codes for all AWS services, then
 * <code>GetServices</code> with a service code to retreive the attribute names for that service. After you have the
 * service code and attribute names, you can use <code>GetAttributeValues</code> to see what values are available for an
 * attribute. With the service code and an attribute name and value, you can use <code>GetProducts</code> to find
 * specific products that you're interested in, such as an <code>AmazonEC2</code> instance, with a
 * <code>Provisioned IOPS</code> <code>volumeType</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Service Endpoint
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Price List Service API provides the following two endpoints:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * https://api.pricing.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * https://api.pricing.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
