 * MPEG-2 TS container settings. These apply to outputs in a File output group when the output's container
 * (ContainerType) is MPEG-2 Transport Stream (M2TS). In these assets, data is organized by the program map table (PMT).
 * Each transport stream program contains subsets of data, including audio, video, and metadata. Each of these subsets
 * of data has a numerical label called a packet identifier (PID). Each transport stream program corresponds to one
 * MediaConvert output. The PMT lists the types of data in a program along with their PID. Downstream systems and
 * players use the program map table to look up the PID for each type of data it accesses and then uses the PIDs to
 * locate specific data within the asset.
