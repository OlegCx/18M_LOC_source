/**
 * Applies only to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and ProRes outputs. Only enable Timecode insertion when the input frame rate is
 * identical to the output frame rate. To include timecodes in this output, set Timecode insertion
 * (VideoTimecodeInsertion) to PIC_TIMING_SEI. To leave them out, set it to DISABLED. Default is DISABLED. When the
 * service inserts timecodes in an output, by default, it uses any embedded timecodes from the input. If none are
 * present, the service will set the timecode for the first output frame to zero. To change this default behavior,
 * adjust the settings under Timecode configuration (TimecodeConfig). In the console, these settings are located under
 * Job > Job settings > Timecode configuration. Note - Timecode source under input settings (InputTimecodeSource) does
 * not affect the timecodes that are inserted in the output. Source under Job settings > Timecode configuration
 * (TimecodeSource) does.
