 * Interface for accessing CodeGuruReviewer.

 * This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API operations. CodeGuru Reviewer is a service
 * that uses program analysis and machine learning to detect potential defects that are difficult for developers to find
 * and recommendations to address them in your Java and Python code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By proactively detecting and providing recommendations for addressing code defects and implementing best practices,
 * CodeGuru Reviewer improves the overall quality and maintainability of your code base during the code review stage.
 * For more information about CodeGuru Reviewer, see the <i> <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html">Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User
 * Guide</a>.</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To improve the security of your CodeGuru Reviewer API calls, you can establish a private connection between your VPC
 * and CodeGuru Reviewer by creating an <i>interface VPC endpoint</i>. For more information, see <a

 * interface VPC endpoints (AWS PrivateLink)</a> in the <i>Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide</i>.
