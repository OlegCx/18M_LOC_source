/**
 * Interface for accessing CodeCommit.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.codecommit.AbstractAWSCodeCommit} instead.

 * <p>
 * This is the <i>AWS CodeCommit API Reference</i>. This reference provides descriptions of the operations and data
