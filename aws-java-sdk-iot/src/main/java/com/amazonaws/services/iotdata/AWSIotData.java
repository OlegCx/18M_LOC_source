 * AWS IoT-Data enables secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected things (such as sensors,
 * actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the AWS cloud. It implements a broker for applications and
 * things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish) and retrieve, update, and delete shadows. A shadow is a persistent
 * representation of your things and their state in the AWS cloud.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Find the endpoint address for actions in the AWS IoT data plane by running this CLI command:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The service name used by <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">AWS
 * Signature Version 4</a> to sign requests is: <i>iotdevicegateway</i>.
