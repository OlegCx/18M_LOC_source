 * <p>
 * <p>
 * AWS IoT Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync, and ML inference capabilities to edge
 * devices. This enables devices to collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react autonomously to
 * local events, and communicate securely with each other on local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely
 * with AWS IoT Core and export IoT data to the AWS Cloud. AWS IoT Greengrass developers can use AWS Lambda functions
 * and components to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge devices for local operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the AWS IoT Greengrass Core software, new APIs, and a
 * new console. Use this API reference to learn how to use the AWS IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage
 * components, manage deployments, and core devices.
