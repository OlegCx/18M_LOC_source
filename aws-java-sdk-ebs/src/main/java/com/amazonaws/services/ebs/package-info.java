/**
 * <p>
 * You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to create EBS snapshots, write data directly to
 * your snapshots, read data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between two snapshots. If youâ€™re
 * an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more
 * efficient and cost-effective to track incremental changes on your EBS volumes through snapshots. This can be done
 * without having to create new volumes from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances
 * to compare the differences.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can create incremental snapshots directly from data on-premises into EBS volumes and the cloud to use for quick
 * disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots, you can write your on-premises data to an EBS
 * snapshot during a disaster. Then after recovery, you can restore it back to AWS or on-premises from the snapshot. You
 * no longer need to build and maintain complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This API reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the EBS
 * direct APIs. For more information about the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use
 * them effectively, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-accessing-snapshot.html">Accessing the Contents of an
 * EBS Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide</i>. For more information about the supported AWS
 * Regions, endpoints, and service quotas for the EBS direct APIs, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ebs-service.html">Amazon Elastic Block Store Endpoints and
 * Quotas</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.
