/**
 * Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of data indexing and querying in the cloud. By
 * offloading the time and effort associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB provides
 * developers the freedom to focus on application development.
 * <p>
 * A traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront capital outlay, is complex to design, and
 * often requires extensive and repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler, requiring
 * no schema, automatically indexing your data and providing a simple API for storage and access. This approach
 * eliminates the administrative burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and performance tuning. Developers gain
 * access to this functionality within Amazon's proven computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and pay only
 * for what they use.
