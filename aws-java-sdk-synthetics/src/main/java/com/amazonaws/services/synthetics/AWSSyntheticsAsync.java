/**
 * Interface for accessing Synthetics asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object
 * representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.synthetics.AbstractAWSSyntheticsAsync} instead.

 * <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics</fullname>
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your services. You can create and manage
 * <i>canaries</i>, which are modular, lightweight scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. You
 * can set up your canaries to run 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you check the availability and
 * latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs,
 * and metrics. The canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch ServiceLens to help you trace the causes of impacted
 * nodes in your applications. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html">Using ServiceLens to Monitor
 * the Health of Your Applications</a> in the <i>Amazon CloudWatch User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Before you create and manage canaries, be aware of the security considerations. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html">Security
 * Considerations for Synthetics Canaries</a>.
