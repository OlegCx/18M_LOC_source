/**
 * <fullname>AWS CodeBuild</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in the cloud. AWS CodeBuild compiles your source code, runs unit
 * tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to deploy. AWS CodeBuild eliminates the need to provision, manage, and
 * scale your own build servers. It provides prepackaged build environments for the most popular programming languages
 * and build tools, such as Apache Maven, Gradle, and more. You can also fully customize build environments in AWS
 * CodeBuild to use your own build tools. AWS CodeBuild scales automatically to meet peak build requests. You pay only
 * for the build time you consume. For more information about AWS CodeBuild, see the <i> <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS CodeBuild User Guide</a>.</i>
