/**
 * Interface for accessing Timestream Write asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object
 * representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.timestreamwrite.AbstractAmazonTimestreamWriteAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time series database service that makes it easy to store and
 * analyze trillions of time series data points per day. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze IoT sensor
 * data to derive insights from your IoT applications. You can analyze industrial telemetry to streamline equipment
 * management and maintenance. You can also store and analyze log data and metrics to improve the performance and
 * availability of your applications. Timestream is built from the ground up to effectively ingest, process, and store
 * time series data. It organizes data to optimize query processing. It automatically scales based on the volume of data
 * ingested and on the query volume to ensure you receive optimal performance while inserting and querying data. As your
 * data grows over time, Timestreamâ€™s adaptive query processing engine spans across storage tiers to provide fast
 * analysis while reducing costs.
