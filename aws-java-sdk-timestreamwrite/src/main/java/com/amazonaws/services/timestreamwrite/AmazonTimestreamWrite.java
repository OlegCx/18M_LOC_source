 * Amazon Timestream is a fast, scalable, fully managed time series database service that makes it easy to store and
 * analyze trillions of time series data points per day. With Timestream, you can easily store and analyze IoT sensor
 * data to derive insights from your IoT applications. You can analyze industrial telemetry to streamline equipment
 * management and maintenance. You can also store and analyze log data and metrics to improve the performance and
 * availability of your applications. Timestream is built from the ground up to effectively ingest, process, and store
 * time series data. It organizes data to optimize query processing. It automatically scales based on the volume of data
 * ingested and on the query volume to ensure you receive optimal performance while inserting and querying data. As your
 * data grows over time, Timestreamâ€™s adaptive query processing engine spans across storage tiers to provide fast
 * analysis while reducing costs.

     * <p>
     * The WriteRecords operation enables you to write your time series data into Timestream. You can specify a single
     * data point or a batch of data points to be inserted into the system. Timestream offers you with a flexible schema
     * that auto detects the column names and data types for your Timestream tables based on the dimension names and
     * data types of the data points you specify when invoking writes into the database. Timestream support eventual
     * consistency read semantics. This means that when you query data immediately after writing a batch of data into
     * Timestream, the query results might not reflect the results of a recently completed write operation. The results
     * may also include some stale data. If you repeat the query request after a short time, the results should return
     * the latest data. Service quotas apply. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/timestream/latest/developerguide/ts-limits.html">Access Management</a> in the
     * Timestream Developer Guide.

     * @return Result of the WriteRecords operation returned by the service.
     * @throws InternalServerException
     *         Timestream was unable to fully process this request because of an internal server error.
     * @throws ThrottlingException
     *         Too many requests were made by a user exceeding service quotas. The request was throttled.
     * @throws ValidationException
     *         Invalid or malformed request.
     * @throws ResourceNotFoundException
     *         The operation tried to access a nonexistent resource. The resource might not be specified correctly, or
     *         its status might not be ACTIVE.
     * @throws AccessDeniedException
     *         You are not authorized to perform this action.
     * @throws RejectedRecordsException
     *         WriteRecords would throw this exception in the following cases: </p>

     *         measure names but different measure values.
     *         </p>
     *         </li>
