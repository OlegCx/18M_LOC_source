/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Import/Export asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object
 * representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.importexport.AbstractAmazonImportExportAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Import/Export Service</fullname> AWS Import/Export accelerates transferring large amounts of data
 * between the AWS cloud and portable storage devices that you mail to us. AWS Import/Export transfers data directly
 * onto and off of your storage devices using Amazon's high-speed internal network and bypassing the Internet. For large
 * data sets, AWS Import/Export is often faster than Internet transfer and more cost effective than upgrading your
 * connectivity.
