/**
 * Interface for accessing AWSHealth asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future object
 * representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.health.AbstractAWSHealthAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Health</fullname>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Health API provides programmatic access to the AWS Health information that appears in the <a
 * href="https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/">AWS Personal Health Dashboard</a>. You can use the API operations to get
 * information about AWS Health events that affect your AWS services and resources.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * You must have a Business or Enterprise support plan from <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS
 * Support</a> to use the AWS Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account that doesn't have a
 * Business or Enterprise support plan, you receive a <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * AWS Health has a single endpoint: health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS). Use this endpoint to call the AWS Health
 * API operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing
 * Process</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If your AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS Health organizational view feature. This
 * feature provides a centralized view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization. You can aggregate
 * AWS Health events in real time to identify accounts in your organization that are affected by an operational event or
 * get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to enable this feature and
 * return event information. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html">Aggregating AWS Health events</a> in the
 * <i>AWS Health User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * When you use the AWS Health API operations to return AWS Health events, see the following recommendations:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Use the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode"
 * >eventScopeCode</a> parameter to specify whether to return AWS Health events that are public or account-specific.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if you call the
 * <code>DescribeEventsForOrganization</code> operation to get all events in your organization, you might receive
 * several page results. Specify the <code>nextToken</code> in the next request to return more results.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </note>
