/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon Cognito Sync.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.cognitosync.AbstractAmazonCognitoSync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>Amazon Cognito Sync</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device syncing of
 * application-related user data. High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these
 * libraries to persist data locally so that it's available even if the device is offline. Developer credentials don't
 * need to be stored on the mobile device to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user
 * ID and credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can
 * have up to 20 datasets per user identity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only to credentials assigned to that
 * identity. In order to use the Cognito Sync service, you need to make API calls using credentials retrieved with <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognitoidentity/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon Cognito Identity
 * service</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will probably want to make API calls via the
 * AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer Guide for
 * Android</a> and the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-sync.html">Developer
 * Guide for iOS</a>.
