     * For an overview of Amazon SageMaker, see <a

     * Calls to <code>InvokeEndpoint</code> are authenticated by using AWS Signature Version 4. For information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
     * Requests (AWS Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 API Reference</i>.

     * <p>
     * A customer's model containers must respond to requests within 60 seconds. The model itself can have a maximum
     * processing time of 60 seconds before responding to invocations. If your model is going to take 50-60 seconds of
     * processing time, the SDK socket timeout should be set to be 70 seconds.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * Endpoints are scoped to an individual account, and are not public. The URL does not contain the account ID, but
     * Amazon SageMaker determines the account ID from the authentication token that is supplied by the caller.
