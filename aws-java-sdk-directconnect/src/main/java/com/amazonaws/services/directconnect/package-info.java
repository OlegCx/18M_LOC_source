 * AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic
 * cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. With this
 * connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon EC2 and
 * Amazon S3) and to Amazon VPC, bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. A connection provides access
 * to all AWS Regions except the China (Beijing) and (China) Ningxia Regions. AWS resources in the China Regions can
 * only be accessed through locations associated with those Regions.
