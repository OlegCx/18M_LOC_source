     *        interface owner. If the owner of the virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on
     *        which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in this state until it is confirmed by the
     *        virtual interface owner.

     *        interface needs validation before the virtual interface can be created.

     *        <li>
     *        <p>
