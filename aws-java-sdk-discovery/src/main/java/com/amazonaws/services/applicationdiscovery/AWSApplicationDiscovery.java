/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Application Discovery Service.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.applicationdiscovery.AbstractAWSApplicationDiscovery} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Application Discovery Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects. It automatically identifies servers,
 * virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ</a>. Application
 * Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your on-premises servers:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Agentless discovery</b> is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require
 * you to install an agent on each host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required
 * for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that
 * information.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Agent-based discovery</b> collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using the AWS Application
 * Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory of running processes, system
 * performance information, resource utilization, and network dependencies.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database
 * in the cloud.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions</b> integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import
 * details of your on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or
 * discovery agent.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Third-party application discovery tools can query AWS Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the
 * Application Discovery Service database using the public API.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications with servers
 * and track migrations.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Recommendations</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and whenever you want to collect
 * information about network dependencies. You can run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless
 * discovery to complete the initial infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to
 * collect additional information.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Working With This Guide</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for
 * Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response.
 * Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or
 * platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS SDKs</a>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home region before you call any of these APIs.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your
 * home region, or a <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error is returned.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home region.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could change. If you call APIs outside the home region, an
 * <code>InvalidInputException</code> is returned.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You must call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> to obtain the latest Migration Hub home region.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * This guide is intended for use with the <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/">AWS Application Discovery Service User
 * Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <important>
 * <p>
 * All data is handled according to the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">AWS Privacy Policy</a>. You can operate
 * Application Discovery Service offline to inspect collected data before it is shared with the service.
