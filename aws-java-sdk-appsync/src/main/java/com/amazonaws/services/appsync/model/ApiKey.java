/**
 * <p>
 * Describes an API key.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Customers invoke AWS AppSync GraphQL API operations with API keys as an identity mechanism. There are two key
 * versions:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>da1</b>: This version was introduced at launch in November 2017. These keys always expire after 7 days. Key
 * expiration is managed by Amazon DynamoDB TTL. The keys ceased to be valid after February 21, 2018 and should not be
 * used after that date.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>ListApiKeys</code> returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>CreateApiKey</code> returns the expiration time in milliseconds.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>UpdateApiKey</code> is not available for this key version.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>DeleteApiKey</code> deletes the item from the table.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Expiration is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as milliseconds. This results in a bug where keys are not automatically
 * deleted because DynamoDB expects the TTL to be stored in seconds. As a one-time action, we will delete these keys
 * from the table after February 21, 2018.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>da2</b>: This version was introduced in February 2018 when AppSync added support to extend key expiration.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>ListApiKeys</code> returns the expiration time and deletion time in seconds.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>CreateApiKey</code> returns the expiration time and deletion time in seconds and accepts a user-provided
 * expiration time in seconds.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>UpdateApiKey</code> returns the expiration time and and deletion time in seconds and accepts a user-provided
 * expiration time in seconds. Expired API keys are kept for 60 days after the expiration time. Key expiration time can
 * be updated while the key is not deleted.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <code>DeleteApiKey</code> deletes the item from the table.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Expiration is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as seconds. After the expiration time, using the key to authenticate will
 * fail. But the key can be reinstated before deletion.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Deletion is stored in Amazon DynamoDB as seconds. The key will be deleted after deletion time.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
