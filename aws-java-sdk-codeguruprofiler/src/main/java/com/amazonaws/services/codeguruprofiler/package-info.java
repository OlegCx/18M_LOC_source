/**
 * <p>
 * This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Profiler API operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CodeGuru Profiler collects runtime performance data from your live applications, and provides recommendations
 * that can help you fine-tune your application performance. Using machine learning algorithms, CodeGuru Profiler can
 * help you find your most expensive lines of code and suggest ways you can improve efficiency and remove CPU
 * bottlenecks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CodeGuru Profiler provides different visualizations of profiling data to help you identify what code is
 * running on the CPU, see how much time is consumed, and suggest ways to reduce CPU utilization.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CodeGuru Profiler currently supports applications written in all Java virtual machine (JVM) languages and
 * Python. While CodeGuru Profiler supports both visualizations and recommendations for applications written in Java, it
 * can also generate visualizations and a subset of recommendations for applications written in other JVM languages and
 * Python.
 * </p>
