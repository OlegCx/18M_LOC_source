/**
 * <fullname>Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights is a service that helps you detect common problems with your applications. It
 * enables you to pinpoint the source of issues in your applications (built with technologies such as Microsoft IIS,
 * .NET, and Microsoft SQL Server), by providing key insights into detected problems.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After you onboard your application, CloudWatch Application Insights identifies, recommends, and sets up metrics and
 * logs. It continuously analyzes and correlates your metrics and logs for unusual behavior to surface actionable
 * problems with your application. For example, if your application is slow and unresponsive and leading to HTTP 500
 * errors in your Application Load Balancer (ALB), Application Insights informs you that a memory pressure problem with
 * your SQL Server database is occurring. It bases this analysis on impactful metrics and log errors.
