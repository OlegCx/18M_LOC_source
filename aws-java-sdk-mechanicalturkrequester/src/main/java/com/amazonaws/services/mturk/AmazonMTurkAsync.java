    /**
     * <p>
     * The <code>UpdateQualificationType</code> operation modifies the attributes of an existing Qualification type,
     * which is represented by a QualificationType data structure. Only the owner of a Qualification type can modify its
     * attributes.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Most attributes of a Qualification type can be changed after the type has been created. However, the Name and
     * Keywords fields cannot be modified. The RetryDelayInSeconds parameter can be modified or added to change the
     * delay or to enable retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds cannot be used to disable retries.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use this operation to update the test for a Qualification type. The test is updated based on the values
     * specified for the Test, TestDurationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All three parameters specify the updated
     * test. If you are updating the test for a type, you must specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds parameters.
     * The AnswerKey parameter is optional; omitting it specifies that the updated test does not have an answer key.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you omit the Test parameter, the test for the Qualification type is unchanged. There is no way to remove a
     * test from a Qualification type that has one. If the type already has a test, you cannot update it to be
     * AutoGranted. If the Qualification type does not have a test and one is provided by an update, the type will
     * henceforth have a test.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you want to update the test duration or answer key for an existing test without changing the questions, you
     * must specify a Test parameter with the original questions, along with the updated values.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will not have an answer key. Requests for such
     * Qualifications must be granted manually.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can also update the AutoGranted and AutoGrantedValue attributes of the Qualification type.
     * </p>
