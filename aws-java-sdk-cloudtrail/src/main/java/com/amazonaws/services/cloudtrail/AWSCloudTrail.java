/**
 * Interface for accessing CloudTrail.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.cloudtrail.AbstractAWSCloudTrail} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS CloudTrail</fullname>
 * <p>
 * This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common
 * errors for CloudTrail.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * CloudTrail is a web service that records AWS API calls for your AWS account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3
 * bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the AWS API call, the source IP
 * address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * As an alternative to the API, you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various
 * programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to
 * create programmatic access to AWSCloudTrail. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests,
 * managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download
 * and install them, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services page</a>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * See the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html">AWS
 * CloudTrail User Guide</a> for information about the data that is included with each AWS API call listed in the log
 * files.

     * Configures an event selector or advanced event selectors for your trail. Use event selectors or advanced event
     * selectors to specify management and data event settings for your trail. By default, trails created without
     * specific event selectors are configured to log all read and write management events, and no data events.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When an event occurs in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selectors or advanced event selectors in all
     * trails. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector, the trail processes and logs the event. If the
     * event doesn't match any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Example
     * </p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You create an event selector for a trail and specify that you want write-only events.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The EC2 <code>GetConsoleOutput</code> and <code>RunInstances</code> API operations occur in your account.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * CloudTrail evaluates whether the events match your event selectors.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The <code>RunInstances</code> is a write-only event and it matches your event selector. The trail logs the event.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The <code>GetConsoleOutput</code> is a read-only event that doesn't match your event selector. The trail doesn't
     * log the event.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * The <code>PutEventSelectors</code> operation must be called from the region in which the trail was created;
     * otherwise, an <code>InvalidHomeRegionException</code> exception is thrown.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can configure up to five event selectors for each trail. For more information, see <a href=
