 * This exception is thrown when the <code>PutEventSelectors</code> operation is called with a number of event
 * selectors, advanced event selectors, or data resources that is not valid. The combination of event selectors or
 * advanced event selectors and data resources is not valid. A trail can have up to 5 event selectors. If a trail uses
 * advanced event selectors, a maximum of 500 total values for all conditions in all advanced event selectors is
 * allowed. A trail is limited to 250 data resources. These data resources can be distributed across event selectors,
 * but the overall total cannot exceed 250.
 * </p>

 * You can:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Specify a valid number of event selectors (1 to 5) for a trail.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Specify a valid number of data resources (1 to 250) for an event selector. The limit of number of resources on an
 * individual event selector is configurable up to 250. However, this upper limit is allowed only if the total number of
 * data resources does not exceed 250 across all event selectors for a trail.

 * <p>
 * Specify up to 500 values for all conditions in all advanced event selectors for a trail.

 * Specify a valid value for a parameter. For example, specifying the <code>ReadWriteType</code> parameter with a value
