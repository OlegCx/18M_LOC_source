     * A NOOP class that is present only for javadoc generation to succeed. We
     * skip the javadoc generation for internal only classes. That leaves us
     * with only package-info.java file in this package. When javadoc is
     * generated for this package, the javadoc tool fails to generate the
     * package summary and as a result it fails to generate javadoc jar.
     *
     * This causes a problem in our maven push as maven needs a javadoc jar and
     * a sources jar. Adding this class would create the javadoc jar.
     *
