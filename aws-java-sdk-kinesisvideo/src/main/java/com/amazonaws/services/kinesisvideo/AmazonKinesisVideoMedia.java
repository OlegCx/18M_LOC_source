     * <p>
     * Use this API to retrieve media content from a Kinesis video stream. In the request, you identify the stream name
     * or stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN), and the starting chunk. Kinesis Video Streams then returns a stream of
     * chunks in order by fragment number.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * You must first call the <code>GetDataEndpoint</code> API to get an endpoint. Then send the <code>GetMedia</code>
     * requests to this endpoint using the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/">--endpoint-url
     * parameter</a>.
     * </p>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * When you put media data (fragments) on a stream, Kinesis Video Streams stores each incoming fragment and related
     * metadata in what is called a "chunk." For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisvideostreams/latest/dg/API_dataplane_PutMedia.html">PutMedia</a>. The
     * <code>GetMedia</code> API returns a stream of these chunks starting from the chunk that you specify in the
     * request.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The following limits apply when using the <code>GetMedia</code> API:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * A client can call <code>GetMedia</code> up to five times per second per stream.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Kinesis Video Streams sends media data at a rate of up to 25 megabytes per second (or 200 megabits per second)
     * during a <code>GetMedia</code> session.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * If an error is thrown after invoking a Kinesis Video Streams media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and
     * the response body, it includes the following pieces of information:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>x-amz-ErrorType</code> HTTP header – contains a more specific error type in addition to what the HTTP
     * status code provides.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>x-amz-RequestId</code> HTTP header – if you want to report an issue to AWS, the support team can better
     * diagnose the problem if given the Request Id.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized to make programmatic decisions about whether
     * errors are retry-able and under what conditions, as well as provide information on what actions the client
     * programmer might need to take in order to successfully try again.
     * </p>
