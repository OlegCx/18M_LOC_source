     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b> <code>LIVE</code> </b>: For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest is continually updated with the

     * one-second interval. When this type of session is played in a media player, the user interface typically displays
     * a "live" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to display.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * In <code>LIVE</code> mode, the newest available fragments are included in an MPEG-DASH manifest, even if there is
     * a gap between fragments (that is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media player to halt
     * or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments are not added to the MPEG-DASH manifest if they are older
     * than the newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes available after a subsequent fragment
     * is added to the manifest, the older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.

     * <li>

     * <b> <code>LIVE_REPLAY</code> </b>: For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest is updated similarly to how
     * it is updated for <code>LIVE</code> mode except that it starts by including fragments from a given start time.
     * Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested, fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment
     * elapses. For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long, then a new fragment is added to the
     * manifest every two seconds. This mode is useful to be able to start playback from when an event is detected and
