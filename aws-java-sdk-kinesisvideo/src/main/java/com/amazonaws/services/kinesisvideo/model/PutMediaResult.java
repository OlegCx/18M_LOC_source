     * After Kinesis Video Streams successfully receives a <code>PutMedia</code> request, the service validates the
     * request headers. The service then starts reading the payload and first sends an HTTP 200 response.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The service then returns a stream containing a series of JSON objects (<code>Acknowledgement</code> objects)
     * separated by newlines. The acknowledgements are received on the same connection on which the media data is sent.
     * There can be many acknowledgements for a <code>PutMedia</code> request. Each <code>Acknowledgement</code>
     * consists of the following key-value pairs:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>

     * <b>Buffering:</b> Kinesis Video Streams has started receiving the fragment. Kinesis Video Streams sends the first
     * Buffering acknowledgement when the first byte of fragment data is received.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Received:</b> Kinesis Video Streams received the entire fragment. If you did not configure the stream to

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Persisted:</b> Kinesis Video Streams has persisted the fragment (for example, to Amazon S3). You get this
     * acknowledgement if you configured the stream to persist the data. After you receive this acknowledgement, the
     * producer can stop buffering the fragment.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Error:</b> Kinesis Video Streams ran into an error while processing the fragment. You can review the error

     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b>Idle:</b> The <code>PutMedia</code> session is in-progress. However, Kinesis Video Streams is currently not

     * </p>

     *        After Kinesis Video Streams successfully receives a <code>PutMedia</code> request, the service validates
     *        the request headers. The service then starts reading the payload and first sends an HTTP 200 response.
     *        </p>
     *        <p>
     *        The service then returns a stream containing a series of JSON objects (<code>Acknowledgement</code>
     *        objects) separated by newlines. The acknowledgements are received on the same connection on which the
     *        media data is sent. There can be many acknowledgements for a <code>PutMedia</code> request. Each
     *        <code>Acknowledgement</code> consists of the following key-value pairs:
     *        </p>
     *        <ul>

     *        <li>
     *        <p>

     *        acknowledgement, the producer can stop buffering the fragment.

     *        <b>Idle:</b> The <code>PutMedia</code> session is in-progress. However, Kinesis Video Streams is currently
     *        not receiving data. Kinesis Video Streams sends this acknowledgement periodically for up to 30 seconds
     *        after the last received data. If no data is received within the 30 seconds, Kinesis Video Streams closes
     *        the request.
