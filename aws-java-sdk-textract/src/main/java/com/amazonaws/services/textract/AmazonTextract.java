     * that make up a line of text.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>StartDocumentTextDetection</code> can analyze text in documents that are in JPEG, PNG, and PDF format. The
     * documents are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use <a>DocumentLocation</a> to specify the bucket name and file name
     * of the document.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>StartTextDetection</code> returns a job identifier (<code>JobId</code>) that you use to get the results of
     * the operation. When text detection is finished, Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the Amazon
     * Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you specify in <code>NotificationChannel</code>. To get the
     * results of the text detection operation, first check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is
     * <code>SUCCEEDED</code>. If so, call <a>GetDocumentTextDetection</a>, and pass the job identifier (
     * <code>JobId</code>) from the initial call to <code>StartDocumentTextDetection</code>.

     * @throws InvalidParameterException
     *         An input parameter violated a constraint. For example, in synchronous operations, an
     *         <code>InvalidParameterException</code> exception occurs when neither of the <code>S3Object</code> or
     *         <code>Bytes</code> values are supplied in the <code>Document</code> request parameter. Validate your
     *         parameter before calling the API operation again.

     * @throws DocumentTooLargeException
     *         The document can't be processed because it's too large. The maximum document size for synchronous
     *         operations 10 MB. The maximum document size for asynchronous operations is 500 MB for PDF files.
