 * The input document, either as bytes or as an S3 object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You pass image bytes to an Amazon Textract API operation by using the <code>Bytes</code> property. For example, you
 * would use the <code>Bytes</code> property to pass a document loaded from a local file system. Image bytes passed by
 * using the <code>Bytes</code> property must be base64 encoded. Your code might not need to encode document file bytes
 * if you're using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract API operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You pass images stored in an S3 bucket to an Amazon Textract API operation by using the <code>S3Object</code>
 * property. Documents stored in an S3 bucket don't need to be base64 encoded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Region for the S3 bucket that contains the S3 object must match the AWS Region that you use for Amazon
 * Textract operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Textract operations, passing image bytes using the Bytes property isn't
 * supported. You must first upload the document to an Amazon S3 bucket, and then call the operation using the S3Object
 * property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For Amazon Textract to process an S3 object, the user must have permission to access the S3 object.
 * </p>
