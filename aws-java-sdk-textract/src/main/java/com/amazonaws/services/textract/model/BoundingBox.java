 * The bounding box around the detected page, text, key-value pair, table, table cell, or selection element on a
 * document page. The <code>left</code> (x-coordinate) and <code>top</code> (y-coordinate) are coordinates that
 * represent the top and left sides of the bounding box. Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin
 * (0,0).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> values returned are ratios of the overall document page size. For example,
 * if the input image is 700 x 200 pixels, and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350 x 50 pixels, the API
 * returns a <code>left</code> value of 0.5 (350/700) and a <code>top</code> value of 0.25 (50/200).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values represent the dimensions of the bounding box as a ratio of the
 * overall document page dimension. For example, if the document page size is 700 x 200 pixels, and the bounding box
 * width is 70 pixels, the width returned is 0.1.
