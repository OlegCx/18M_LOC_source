 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Migration Hub API methods help to obtain server and application migration status and integrate your

 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Remember that you must set your AWS Migration Hub home region before you call any of these APIs, or a
 * <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error will be returned. Also, you must make the API calls while in your home
