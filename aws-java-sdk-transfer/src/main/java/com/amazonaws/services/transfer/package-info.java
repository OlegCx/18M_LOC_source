/**
 * <p>
 * AWS Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of files over the File Transfer Protocol
 * (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into and
 * out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). AWS helps you seamlessly migrate your file transfer workflows to
 * AWS Transfer Family by integrating with existing authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route
 * 53 so nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With your data in Amazon S3, you can
 * use it with AWS services for processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with AWS
 * Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set up.
