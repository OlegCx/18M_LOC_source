/**
 * <p>
 * Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you analyze and investigate security issues
 * across your Amazon Web Services (AWS) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login
 * attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs.
 * It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the
 * extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage graphs that belong to the Region
 * that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A Detective administrator account can use the Detective API to do the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Add member accounts to a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A member account can use the Detective API to do the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Remove their account from a behavior graph.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging Detective API
 * Calls with CloudTrail</a>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator account." An administrator account is used to
 * centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in their
 * behavior graph.
