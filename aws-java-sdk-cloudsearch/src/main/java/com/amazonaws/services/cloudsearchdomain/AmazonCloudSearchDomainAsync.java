 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.cloudsearchdomain.AbstractAmazonCloudSearchDomainAsync} instead.

 * The endpoints for submitting <code>UploadDocuments</code>, <code>Search</code>, and <code>Suggest</code> requests are
 * domain-specific. To get the endpoints for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service
 * <code>DescribeDomains</code> action. The domain endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon
