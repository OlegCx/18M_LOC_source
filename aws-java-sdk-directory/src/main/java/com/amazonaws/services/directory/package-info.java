 * AWS Directory Service is a web service that makes it easy for you to setup and run directories in the AWS cloud, or
 * connect your AWS resources with an existing on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. This guide provides detailed
 * information about AWS Directory Service operations, data types, parameters, and errors. For information about AWS
 * Directory Services features, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/">AWS Directory Service</a> and the
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html">AWS Directory Service
 * Administration Guide</a>.

 * <note>
 * <p>
 * AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java,
 * Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS Directory
 * Service and other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them,
