/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon CloudWatch Events asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future
 * object representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.cloudwatchevents.AbstractAmazonCloudWatchEventsAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. When your resources change state,
 * they automatically send events into an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream
 * and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For
 * example, you can configure rules to:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance
 * enters the running state.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Direct specific API records from AWS CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of potential
 * security or availability risks.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For more information about the features of Amazon EventBridge, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide">Amazon EventBridge User Guide</a>.

     * Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a
     * matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can
     * have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as
     * on a schedule.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you
     * organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user
     * permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the <code>PutRule</code> operation and

     * <p>
     * If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the <code>PutRule</code> operation are ignored. To

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge
     * uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event
     * patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For
     * example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the
     * desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again,
     * creating an infinite loop.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your
     * rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which
     * alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit. For more information, see <a

     * send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when
     * you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for
     * each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event
     * is not charged. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/">Amazon

     * <p>
     * If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your

     * <code>EC2 StopInstances API call</code>, and <code>EC2 TerminateInstances API call</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For some target types, <code>PutTargets</code> provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis
     * data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the <code>KinesisParameters</code>
     * argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the
     * <code>RunCommandParameters</code> field.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) needs the
     * appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies.
     * For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, AWS Step Functions state machines and API Gateway REST APIs, EventBridge
     * relies on IAM roles that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>. For more
     * information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/auth-and-access-control-eventbridge.html"

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If another AWS account is in the same region and has granted you permission (using <code>PutPermission</code>),
     * you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To
     * send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when
     * you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for
     * each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event
     * is not charged. For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/pricing/">Amazon
     * EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) Pricing</a>.

     * <note>
     * <p>
     * <code>Input</code>, <code>InputPath</code>, and <code>InputTransformer</code> are not available with
     * <code>PutTarget</code> if the target is an event bus of a different AWS account.
     * </p>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * If you are setting the event bus of another account as the target, and that account granted permission to your
     * account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a
     * <code>RoleArn</code> with proper permissions in the <code>Target</code> structure. For more information, see <a
