/**
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from EC2 instances, AWS CloudTrail,
 * or other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch console,
 * CloudWatch Logs commands in the AWS CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use CloudWatch Logs to:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real-time</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems
 * using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and
 * send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your
 * log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific
 * literal terms (such as "NullReferenceException") or count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular
 * position in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is
 * found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Monitor AWS CloudTrail logged events</b>: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of
 * particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to perform troubleshooting.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Archive log data</b>: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage. You can change
 * the log retention setting so that any log events older than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch
 * Logs agent makes it easy to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log
 * service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
