/**
 * Interface for accessing Pinpoint Email.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.pinpointemail.AbstractAmazonPinpointEmail} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>Amazon Pinpoint Email Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the <i>Amazon Pinpoint Email API Reference</i>. This guide provides information about the Amazon Pinpoint
 * Email API (version 1.0), including supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Amazon Pinpoint</a> is an AWS service that you can use to engage with your
 * customers across multiple messaging channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text messages, voice
 * messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API provides programmatic access to options that are
 * unique to the email channel and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to also review the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide</a>.
 * The <i>Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide</i> provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate how to
 * use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and
 * other types of applications. The guide also provides information about key topics such as Amazon Pinpoint integration
 * with other AWS services and the limits that apply to using the service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these
 * Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region">AWS Service Endpoints</a> in the
 * <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>. To learn more about AWS Regions, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing AWS Regions</a> in the <i>Amazon Web
 * Services General Reference</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each
 * other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These
 * Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing
 * latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a>.
