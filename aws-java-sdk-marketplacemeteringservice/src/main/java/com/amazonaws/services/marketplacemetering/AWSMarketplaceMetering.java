/**
 * Interface for accessing AWSMarketplace Metering.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.marketplacemetering.AbstractAWSMarketplaceMetering} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage dimensions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html">AWS
 * Marketing metering and entitlement API permissions</a> in the <i>AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Submitting Metering Records</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <i>MeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance
 * or a container running on EKS or ECS.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <i>BatchMeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a set of customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a
 * software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Accepting New Customers</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <i>ResolveCustomer</i>- Called by a SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your
 * website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration
 * Token is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier and Product Code.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering
 * Service and call the RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon
 * ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your
 * seller reports. For more information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html">Container-Based
 * Products</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering
 * records that you sent are accurate by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use
 * CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the <i> <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html">AWS CloudTrail User
 * Guide</a> </i>.

     * receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the behavior of RegisterUsage.
     * RegisterUsage performs two primary functions: metering and entitlement.
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <i>Entitlement</i>: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the customer running your paid software is subscribed
     * to your product on AWS Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your container image that
     * integrates with RegisterUsage is only required to guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a
     * CustomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException will only be thrown on the initial call to
     * RegisterUsage. Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not
     * throw a CustomerNotSubscribedException, even if the customer unsubscribes while the Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS
     * pod is still running.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <i>Metering</i>: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage
     * prorated to the second. A minimum of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a
     * customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and a service configured as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS
     * or Amazon EKS will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer will be charged: (10 * hourly_rate).
     * Metering for software use is automatically handled by the AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane -- your software
     * is not required to perform any metering specific actions, other than call RegisterUsage once for metering of
     * software use to commence. The AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill customers for
     * running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customers subscription state, removing the need for your
     * software to perform entitlement checks at runtime.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * 
     * @param registerUsageRequest
     * @return Result of the RegisterUsage operation returned by the service.
     * @throws InvalidProductCodeException
     *         The product code passed does not match the product code used for publishing the product.
     * @throws InvalidRegionException
     *         RegisterUsage must be called in the same AWS Region the ECS task was launched in. This prevents a
     *         container from hardcoding a Region (e.g. withRegion(“us-east-1”) when calling RegisterUsage.
     * @throws InvalidPublicKeyVersionException
     *         Public Key version is invalid.
