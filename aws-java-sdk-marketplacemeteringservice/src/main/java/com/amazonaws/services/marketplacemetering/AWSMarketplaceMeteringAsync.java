/**
 * Interface for accessing AWSMarketplace Metering asynchronously. Each asynchronous method will return a Java Future
 * object representing the asynchronous operation; overloads which accept an {@code AsyncHandler} can be used to receive
 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.marketplacemetering.AbstractAWSMarketplaceMeteringAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Marketplace Metering Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * This reference provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace Metering Service API.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage dimensions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/iam-user-policy-for-aws-marketplace-actions.html">AWS
 * Marketing metering and entitlement API permissions</a> in the <i>AWS Marketplace Seller Guide.</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Submitting Metering Records</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <i>MeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance
 * or a container running on EKS or ECS.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <i>BatchMeterUsage</i>- Submits the metering record for a set of customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a
 * software-as-a-service (SaaS) application.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Accepting New Customers</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <i>ResolveCustomer</i>- Called by a SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your
 * website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration
 * Token is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier and Product Code.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering
 * Service and call the RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon
 * ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your
 * seller reports. For more information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/container-based-products.html">Container-Based
 * Products</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering
 * records that you sent are accurate by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use
 * CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the <i> <a
 * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-concepts.html">AWS CloudTrail User
 * Guide</a> </i>.
 * </p>
