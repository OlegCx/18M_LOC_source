     * <p>
     * <b>Change Batches and Transactional Changes</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The request body must include a document with a <code>ChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest</code> element. The request
     * body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional
     * changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the
     * change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely affected by partial changes to the resource
     * record sets in a hosted zone.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes the <code>CNAME</code> resource
     * record set for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for
     * both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set
     * in a single operation. If validation for either the <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails,
     * then the request is canceled, and the original <code>CNAME</code> record continues to exist.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an
     * <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code> error.

     * </note>
     * <p>
     * <b>Traffic Flow</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in
     * the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the configuration
     * as a traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or
     * subdomain names (such as www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll back

     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <b>Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The syntax for a request depends on the type of resource record set that you want to create, delete, or update,

     * <b>Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers</b>

     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you

     * as a database server.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is
     * based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the
     * Amazon EC2 <code>StatusCheckFailed</code> metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that

     * <b>ELB Load Balancers</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you're registering EC2 instances with an Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) load balancer, do not create Amazon
     * Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a load balancer, you
     * configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a similar function to a Route 53 health check.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <b>Private Hosted Zones</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in a private hosted zone. Note the following:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you
     * must assign a public IP address to the instance in the VPC.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external resource that the instance relies on, such
     * as a database server.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the metric, and then create a health check that is
     * based on the state of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that checks the status of the
     * Amazon EC2 <code>StatusCheckFailed</code> metric, add an alarm to the metric, and then create a health check that
     * is based on the state of the alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the
     * CloudWatch console, see the <a

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In the next step, you'll create a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log groups and the
     * associated AWS resources, such as Route 53 hosted zones. There's a limit on the number of resource policies that
     * you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent prefix so you can use the same resource policy for all
     * the log groups that you create for query logging.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions that Route 53 needs to create log streams
     * and to send query logs to log streams. For the value of <code>Resource</code>, specify the ARN for the log group
     * that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource policy for all the CloudWatch Logs log groups
     * that you created for query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with <code>*</code>, for example:
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*</code>
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * You can't use the CloudWatch console to create or edit a resource policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of
     * the AWS SDKs, or the AWS CLI.

     * <dt>Log Streams and Edge Locations</dt>
     * <dd>
     * <p>
     * When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for DNS query logging, it does the following:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Creates a log stream for an edge location the first time that the edge location responds to DNS queries for the
     * specified hosted zone. That log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to for that edge
     * location.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The name of each log stream is in the following format:
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code> <i>hosted zone ID</i>/<i>edge location code</i> </code>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The edge location code is a three-letter code and an arbitrarily assigned number, for example, DFW3. The
     * three-letter code typically corresponds with the International Air Transport Association airport code for an
     * airport near the edge location. (These abbreviations might change in the future.) For a list of edge locations,
     * see "The Route 53 Global Network" on the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/details/">Route 53 Product
     * Details</a> page.

     * </dd>
     * <dt>Queries That Are Logged</dt>
     * <dd>
     * <p>
     * Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route 53. If a DNS resolver has already cached
     * the response to a query (such as the IP address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver will continue
     * to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another query to Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding
     * resource record set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a resource record set, and
     * depending on the TTL for that resource record set, query logs might contain information about only one query out
     * of every several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS. For more information about how DNS works, see <a

     * <b>Sort order</b>

     * <p>
     * <code>com.example.www.</code>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order when the record name contains characters that appear
     * before <code>.</code> (decimal 46) in the ASCII table. These characters include the following:
     * <code>! " # $ % &amp; ' ( ) * + , -</code>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When multiple records have the same DNS name, <code>ListResourceRecordSets</code> sorts results by the record

     * <p>
     * <b>Specifying where to start listing records</b>
     * </p>

     * <dd>
     * <p>

     * <dd>
     * <p>
     * The results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose name is greater than or equal to
     * <code>Name</code>.
