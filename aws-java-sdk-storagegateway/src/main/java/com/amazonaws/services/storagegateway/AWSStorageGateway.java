/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Storage Gateway.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.storagegateway.AbstractAWSStorageGateway} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Storage Gateway Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Storage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to
 * provide seamless and secure integration between an organization's on-premises IT environment and the AWS storage
 * infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to the AWS Cloud for cost effective backup and rapid
 * disaster recovery.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use the following links to get started using the <i>AWS Storage Gateway Service API Reference</i>:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#AWSStorageGatewayHTTPRequestsHeaders"
 * >AWS Storage Gateway required request headers</a>: Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST
 * request to AWS Storage Gateway.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a href=
 * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/AWSStorageGatewayAPI.html#AWSStorageGatewaySigningRequests"
 * >Signing requests</a>: AWS Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send; this topic
 * describes how sign such a request.
 * </p>
 * </li>

 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">Operations in AWS
 * Storage Gateway</a>: Contains detailed descriptions of all AWS Storage Gateway operations, their request parameters,
 * response elements, possible errors, and examples of requests and responses.
 * </p>

 * <p>
 * <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sg.html">AWS Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas</a>:
 * Provides a list of each AWS Region and the endpoints available for use with AWS Storage Gateway.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * AWS Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2
 * expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For
 * example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be <code>vol-AA22BB012345DAF670</code>. When you use this ID
 * with the EC2 API, you must change it to <code>vol-aa22bb012345daf670</code>. Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave
 * as expected.
 * </p>
 * </note> <important>
 * <p>
 * IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer
 * format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting
 * in April 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For more
 * information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/#longer-ids">Longer EC2 and EBS resource IDs</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID format looks like the following:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following: <code>snap-78e226633445566ee</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information, see <a href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=3557">Announcement: Heads-up â€“ Longer
 * AWS Storage Gateway volume and snapshot IDs coming in 2016</a>.
