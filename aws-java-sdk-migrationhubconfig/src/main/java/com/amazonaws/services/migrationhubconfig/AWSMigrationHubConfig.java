/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Migration Hub Config.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.migrationhubconfig.AbstractAWSMigrationHubConfig} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for working with your Migration Hub home region.
 * You can use these APIs to determine a home region, as well as to create and work with controls that describe the home
 * region.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your
 * home region, or a <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error is returned.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home region.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * If you call a write API outside the home region, an <code>InvalidInputException</code> is returned.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You can call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> action to obtain the account's Migration Hub home region.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For specific API usage, see the sections that follow in this AWS Migration Hub Home Region API reference.
