     * Because buckets can contain a virtually unlimited number of keys, the
     * complete results of a list query can be extremely large. To manage large
     * result sets, Amazon S3 uses pagination to split them into multiple
     * responses. Always check the
     * {@link ObjectListing#isTruncated()} method to see if the returned
     * listing is complete or if additional calls are needed to get
     * more results. Alternatively, use the
     * {@link AmazonS3Client#listNextBatchOfObjects(ObjectListing)} method as
     * an easy way to get the next page of object listings.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Calling {@link ListObjectsRequest#setDelimiter(String)}
     * sets the delimiter, allowing groups of keys that share the
     * delimiter-terminated prefix to be included
     * in the returned listing. This allows applications to organize and browse
     * their keys hierarchically, similar to how a file system organizes files
     * into directories. These common prefixes can be retrieved
     * through the {@link ObjectListing#getCommonPrefixes()} method.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, consider a bucket that contains the following keys:
     * <ul>
     * 	<li>"foo/bar/baz"</li>
     * 	<li>"foo/bar/bash"</li>
     * 	<li>"foo/bar/bang"</li>
     * 	<li>"foo/boo"</li>
     * </ul>
     * If calling <code>listObjects</code> with
     * a prefix value of "foo/" and a delimiter value of "/"
     * on this bucket, an <code>ObjectListing</code> is returned that contains one key
     * ("foo/boo") and one entry in the common prefixes list ("foo/bar/").
     * To see deeper into the virtual hierarchy, make another
     * call to <code>listObjects</code> setting the prefix parameter to any interesting
     * common prefix to list the individual keys under that prefix.
     * </p>

     * <p>
     * Returns a list of summary information about the versions in the specified
     * bucket.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The returned version summaries are ordered first by key and then by
     * version. Keys are sorted lexicographically (alphabetically)
     * and versions are sorted from most recent to least recent.
     * Versions
     * with data and delete markers are included in the results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Because buckets can contain a virtually unlimited number of versions, the
     * complete results of a list query can be extremely large. To manage large
     * result sets, Amazon S3 uses pagination to split them into multiple
     * responses. Always check the
     * {@link VersionListing#isTruncated()} method to determine if the
     * returned listing is complete or if additional calls are needed
     * to get more results.
     * Callers are
     * encouraged to use
     * {@link AmazonS3#listNextBatchOfVersions(VersionListing)} as an easy way
     * to get the next page of results.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>keyMarker</code> and <code>versionIdMarker</code> parameters allow
     * callers to specify where to start the version listing.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The <code>delimiter</code> parameter allows groups of keys that share a
     * delimiter-terminated prefix to be included
     * in the returned listing. This allows applications to organize and browse
     * their keys hierarchically, much like how a file system organizes
     * files into directories. These common prefixes can be retrieved
     * by calling the {@link VersionListing#getCommonPrefixes()} method.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example, consider a bucket that contains the following keys:
     * <ul>
     *  <li>"foo/bar/baz"</li>
     *  <li>"foo/bar/bash"</li>
     *  <li>"foo/bar/bang"</li>
     *  <li>"foo/boo"</li>
     * </ul>
     * If calling <code>listVersions</code> with
     * a <code>prefix</code> value of "foo/" and a <code>delimiter</code> value of "/"
     * on this bucket, a <code>VersionListing</code> is returned that contains:
     *  <ul>
     *      <li>all the versions for one key ("foo/boo")</li>
     *      <li>one entry in the common prefixes list ("foo/bar/")</li>
     *  </ul>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To see deeper into the virtual hierarchy, make
     * another call to <code>listVersions</code> setting the prefix parameter to any
     * interesting common prefix to list the individual versions under that
     * prefix.
     * </p>

     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * When uploading directly from an input stream:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Be careful to set the correct content type in the metadata object
     * before directly sending a stream. Unlike file uploads, content types from
     * input streams cannot be automatically determined. If the caller doesn't
     * explicitly set the content type, it will not be set in Amazon S3.</li>
     * <li>Content length <b>must</b> be specified before data can be uploaded
     * to Amazon S3. Amazon S3 explicitly requires that the content length be
     * sent in the request headers before it will accept any of the data. If the
     * caller doesn't provide the length, the library must buffer the contents
     * of the input stream in order to calculate it.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If versioning is enabled for the specified bucket, this operation will
     * never overwrite an existing object with the same key, but will keep the
     * existing object as an older version until that version is explicitly

     * <p>
     * A bucket's versioning configuration can be in one of three possible
     * states:
     *  <ul>
     *      <li>{@link BucketVersioningConfiguration#OFF}
     *      <li>{@link BucketVersioningConfiguration#ENABLED}
     *      <li>{@link BucketVersioningConfiguration#SUSPENDED}
     *  </ul>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * By default, new buckets are in the
     * {@link BucketVersioningConfiguration#OFF off} state. Once versioning is
     * enabled for a bucket the status can never be reverted to
     * {@link BucketVersioningConfiguration#OFF off}.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Objects created before versioning was enabled or when versioning is
     * suspended will be given the default <code>null</code> version ID (see
     * {@link Constants#NULL_VERSION_ID}). Note that the
     * <code>null</code> version ID is a valid version ID and is not the
     * same as not having a version ID.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The versioning configuration of a bucket has different implications for
     * each operation performed on that bucket or for objects within that
     * bucket. For example, when versioning is enabled a <code>PutObject</code>
     * operation creates a unique object version-id for the object being uploaded. The
     * The <code>PutObject</code> API guarantees that, if versioning is enabled for a bucket at
     * the time of the request, the new object can only be permanently deleted
     * using a <code>DeleteVersion</code> operation. It can never be overwritten.

     * Define the SQL expression for the <code>SELECT</code> type of restoration for your query in the request body's
     * <code>SelectParameters</code> structure. You can use expressions like the following examples.
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The following expression returns all records from the specified object.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>SELECT * FROM Object</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Assuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with
     * positional headers.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 &gt; 100</code>
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If you have headers and you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> in the <code>CSV</code> structure in the request
     * body to <code>USE</code>, you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the <code>fileHeaderInfo</code> field
     * to <code>IGNORE</code>, the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header
     * column names.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * <code>SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s</code>

     * Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When making a select request, you can also do the following:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * To expedite your queries, specify the <code>Expedited</code> tier. For more information about tiers, see
     * "Restoring Archives," later in this topic.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Specify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the
     * serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The following are additional important facts about the select feature:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly
     * deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn't deduplicate requests,
     * so avoid issuing duplicate requests.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Amazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return
     * error response <code>409</code>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <b>Restoring Archives</b>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Objects in the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are archived. To access an archived object, you must
     * first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the archived object. In a restore request,
     * you must specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon
     * S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that
     * object was restored from.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3
     * restores the current version.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being restored from and
     * which data access tier you specify.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access
     * tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the
     * GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the
     * largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within
     * 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you
     * need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - S3 Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within
     * several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do not specify
     * the retrieval option. S3 Standard retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class
     * and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you
     * to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete
     * within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE
     * storage class.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data
     * access, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html">Restoring Archived
     * Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in
     * progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing another restore request to the same
     * object, setting a new <code>Tier</code> request element. When issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you
     * must choose a tier that is faster than the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any
     * other parameters, such as the <code>Days</code> request element. For more information, see <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html"
     * > Upgrading the Speed of an In-Progress Restore</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the
     * <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You
     * can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more
     * information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html">Configuring
     * Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new
     * period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the
     * request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively
     * processing your current restore request for the object.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object
     * expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object
     * copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For
     * more information about lifecycle configuration, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration.html"
     * >PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration</a> and <a

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A replication configuration must include at least one rule, and can contain a maximum of 1,000. Each rule
     * identifies a subset of objects to replicate by filtering the objects in the source bucket. To choose additional
     * subsets of objects to replicate, add a rule for each subset.

     * <p>
     * To specify a subset of the objects in the source bucket to apply a replication rule to, add the Filter element as
     * a child of the Rule element. You can filter objects based on an object key prefix, one or more object tags, or
     * both. When you add the Filter element in the configuration, you must also add the following elements:
     * <code>DeleteMarkerReplication</code>, <code>Status</code>, and <code>Priority</code>.
