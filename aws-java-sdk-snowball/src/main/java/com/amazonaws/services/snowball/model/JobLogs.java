/**
 * <p>
 * Contains job logs. Whenever a Snow device is used to import data into or export data out of Amazon S3, you'll have
 * the option of downloading a PDF job report. Job logs are returned as a part of the response syntax of the
 * <code>DescribeJob</code> action in the <code>JobMetadata</code> data type. The job logs can be accessed for up to 60
 * minutes after this request has been made. To access any of the job logs after 60 minutes have passed, you'll have to
 * make another call to the <code>DescribeJob</code> action.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For import jobs, the PDF job report becomes available at the end of the import process. For export jobs, your job
 * report typically becomes available while the Snow device for your job part is being delivered to you.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The job report provides you insight into the state of your Amazon S3 data transfer. The report includes details about
 * your job or job part for your records.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For deeper visibility into the status of your transferred objects, you can look at the two associated logs: a success
 * log and a failure log. The logs are saved in comma-separated value (CSV) format, and the name of each log includes
 * the ID of the job or job part that the log describes.
