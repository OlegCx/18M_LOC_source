 * enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow device. To transfer data locally with a Snow device, you'll need to
 * use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or AWS OpsHub for Snow Family. For more
 * information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User
