/**
 * <p>
 * AWS Snow Family is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to transfer large amounts of
 * data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The Snow commands described
 * here provide access to the same functionality that is available in the AWS Snow Family Management Console, which
 * enables you to create and manage jobs for a Snow device. To transfer data locally with a Snow device, you'll need to
 * use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or AWS OpsHub for Snow Family. For more
 * information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User
 * Guide</a>.
