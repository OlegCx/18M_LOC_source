/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon Appflow.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.appflow.AbstractAmazonAppflow} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the Amazon AppFlow API reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the
 * Amazon AppFlow API operations, data types, and errors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to securely transfer data between software as
 * a service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like Amazon S3 and
 * Amazon Redshift.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use the following links to get started on the Amazon AppFlow API:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/1.0/APIReference/API_Operations.html">Actions</a>: An alphabetical list
 * of all Amazon AppFlow API operations.
 * </p>
 * </li>

 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If you're new to Amazon AppFlow, we recommend that you review the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appflow/latest/userguide/what-is-appflow.html">Amazon AppFlow User Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon AppFlow API users can use vendor-specific mechanisms for OAuth, and include applicable OAuth attributes (such
 * as <code>auth-code</code> and <code>redirecturi</code>) with the connector-specific
 * <code>ConnectorProfileProperties</code> when creating a new connector profile using Amazon AppFlow API operations.
 * For example, Salesforce users can refer to the <a
 * href="https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_authenticate.htm"> <i>Authorize Apps with OAuth</i>
 * </a> documentation.
