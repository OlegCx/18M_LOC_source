 * a service (SaaS) applications like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like Amazon S3 and
 * Amazon Redshift.

 * Amazon AppFlow API users can use vendor-specific mechanisms for OAuth, and include applicable OAuth attributes (such
 * as <code>auth-code</code> and <code>redirecturi</code>) with the connector-specific
 * <code>ConnectorProfileProperties</code> when creating a new connector profile using Amazon AppFlow API operations.
 * For example, Salesforce users can refer to the <a
