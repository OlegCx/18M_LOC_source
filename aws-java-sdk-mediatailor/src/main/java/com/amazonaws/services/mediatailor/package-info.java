 * Use the AWS Elemental MediaTailor SDKs and CLI to configure scalable ad insertion and linear channels. With
 * MediaTailor, you can assemble existing content into a linear stream and serve targeted ads to viewers while
 * maintaining broadcast quality in over-the-top (OTT) video applications. For information about using the service,
 * including detailed information about the settings covered in this guide, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/">AWS Elemental MediaTailor User Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Through the SDKs and the CLI you manage AWS Elemental MediaTailor configurations and channels the same as you do
 * through the console. For example, you specify ad insertion behavior and mapping information for the origin server and
 * the ad decision server (ADS).
