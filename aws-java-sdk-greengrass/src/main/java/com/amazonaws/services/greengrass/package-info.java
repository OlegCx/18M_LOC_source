/**
 * AWS IoT Greengrass seamlessly extends AWS onto physical devices so they can act locally on the data they generate,
 * while still using the cloud for management, analytics, and durable storage. AWS IoT Greengrass ensures your devices
 * can respond quickly to local events and operate with intermittent connectivity. AWS IoT Greengrass minimizes the cost
 * of transmitting data to the cloud by allowing you to author AWS Lambda functions that execute locally.
