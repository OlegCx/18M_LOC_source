/**
 * <fullname>Amazon SES API v2</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the Amazon SES API v2 Reference. This guide provides information about the Amazon SES API v2, including
 * supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Amazon SES</a> is an AWS service that you can use to send email messages to
 * your customers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you're new to Amazon SES API v2, you might find it helpful to also review the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/">Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide</a>. The
 * <i>Amazon SES Developer Guide</i> provides information and code samples that demonstrate how to use Amazon SES API v2
 * features programmatically.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Amazon SES API v2 is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For
 * a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ses_region">AWS Service Endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon
 * Web Services General Reference</i>. To learn more about AWS Regions, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing AWS Regions</a> in the <i>Amazon Web
 * Services General Reference</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each
 * other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These
 * Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing
 * latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/">AWS Global Infrastructure</a>.
