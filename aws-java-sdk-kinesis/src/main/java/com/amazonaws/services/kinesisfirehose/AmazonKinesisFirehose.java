     * Creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * By default, you can create up to 50 delivery streams per AWS Region.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This is an asynchronous operation that immediately returns. The initial status of the delivery stream is
     * <code>CREATING</code>. After the delivery stream is created, its status is <code>ACTIVE</code> and it now accepts
     * data. If the delivery stream creation fails, the status transitions to <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>. Attempts to
     * send data to a delivery stream that is not in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state cause an exception. To check the
     * state of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the status of a delivery stream is <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, this status doesn't change, and you can't
     * invoke <code>CreateDeliveryStream</code> again on it. However, you can invoke the <a>DeleteDeliveryStream</a>
     * operation to delete it.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to receive records directly from providers using
     * <a>PutRecord</a> or <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, or it can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its
     * source. To specify a Kinesis data stream as input, set the <code>DeliveryStreamType</code> parameter to
     * <code>KinesisStreamAsSource</code>, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and role ARN in the
     * <code>KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration</code> parameter.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To create a delivery stream with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled, include
     * <a>DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput</a> in your request. This is optional. You can also invoke
     * <a>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</a> to turn on SSE for an existing delivery stream that doesn't have SSE
     * enabled.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A delivery stream is configured with a single destination: Amazon S3, Amazon ES, Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You
     * must specify only one of the following destination configuration parameters:
     * <code>ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>,
     * <code>ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration</code>, or
     * <code>SplunkDestinationConfiguration</code>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When you specify <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, you can also provide the following optional values:
     * BufferingHints, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>, and <code>CompressionFormat</code>. By default, if no
     * <code>BufferingHints</code> value is provided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes,
     * whichever condition is satisfied first. <code>BufferingHints</code> is a hint, so there are some cases where the
     * service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record boundaries might be such that the size is
     * a little over or under the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly
     * recommend that you enable encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location. Kinesis Data Firehose first
     * delivers data to Amazon S3 and then uses <code>COPY</code> syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table.
     * This is specified in the <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> parameter.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The compression formats <code>SNAPPY</code> or <code>ZIP</code> cannot be specified in
     * <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> because the Amazon Redshift <code>COPY</code>
     * operation that reads from the S3 bucket doesn't support these compression formats.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * We strongly recommend that you use the user name and password you provide exclusively with Kinesis Data Firehose,
     * and that the permissions for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift <code>INSERT</code> permissions.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Kinesis Data Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of the destination. The role should allow
     * the Kinesis Data Firehose principal to assume the role, and the role should have permissions that allow the
     * service to deliver the data. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3">Grant Kinesis Data
     * Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide</i>.

     * This operation is asynchronous. It returns immediately. When you invoke it, Kinesis Data Firehose first sets the
     * encryption status of the stream to <code>ENABLING</code>, and then to <code>ENABLED</code>. The encryption status
     * of a delivery stream is the <code>Status</code> property in <a>DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfiguration</a>. If the
     * operation fails, the encryption status changes to <code>ENABLING_FAILED</code>. You can continue to read and
     * write data to your delivery stream while the encryption status is <code>ENABLING</code>, but the data is not
     * encrypted. It can take up to 5 seconds after the encryption status changes to <code>ENABLED</code> before all
     * records written to the delivery stream are encrypted. To find out whether a record or a batch of records was
     * encrypted, check the response elements <a>PutRecordOutput$Encrypted</a> and
     * <a>PutRecordBatchOutput$Encrypted</a>, respectively.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To check the encryption status of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Even if encryption is currently enabled for a delivery stream, you can still invoke this operation on it to
     * change the ARN of the CMK or both its type and ARN. If you invoke this method to change the CMK, and the old CMK
     * is of type <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK</code>, Kinesis Data Firehose schedules the grant it had on the old CMK for
     * retirement. If the new CMK is of type <code>CUSTOMER_MANAGED_CMK</code>, Kinesis Data Firehose creates a grant
     * that enables it to use the new CMK to encrypt and decrypt data and to manage the grant.

     * <p>
     * If a delivery stream already has encryption enabled and then you invoke this operation to change the ARN of the
     * CMK or both its type and ARN and you get <code>ENABLING_FAILED</code>, this only means that the attempt to change
     * the CMK failed. In this case, encryption remains enabled with the old CMK.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If the encryption status of your delivery stream is <code>ENABLING_FAILED</code>, you can invoke this operation
     * again with a valid CMK. The CMK must be enabled and the key policy mustn't explicitly deny the permission for
     * Kinesis Data Firehose to invoke KMS encrypt and decrypt operations.
