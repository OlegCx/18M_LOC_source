/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS IoT Jobs Data Plane.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.iotjobsdataplane.AbstractAWSIoTJobsDataPlane} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote operations that are sent to and executed
 * on one or more devices connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices to
 * download and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting
 * operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote operations to be performed, and you
 * specify a list of targets that should perform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing groups or
 * both.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The target starts the execution of the
 * job by downloading the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS IoT.
 * The Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific target and for all the targets of the
 * job
 * </p>
