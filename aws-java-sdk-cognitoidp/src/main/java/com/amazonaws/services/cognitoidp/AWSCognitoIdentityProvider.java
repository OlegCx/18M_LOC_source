     * <p>
     * A custom domain is used to host the Amazon Cognito hosted UI, which provides sign-up and sign-in pages for your
     * application. When you set up a custom domain, you provide a certificate that you manage with AWS Certificate
     * Manager (ACM). When necessary, you can use this operation to change the certificate that you applied to your
     * custom domain.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Usually, this is unnecessary following routine certificate renewal with ACM. When you renew your existing
     * certificate in ACM, the ARN for your certificate remains the same, and your custom domain uses the new
     * certificate automatically.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * However, if you replace your existing certificate with a new one, ACM gives the new certificate a new ARN. To
     * apply the new certificate to your custom domain, you must provide this ARN to Amazon Cognito.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When you add your new certificate in ACM, you must choose US East (N. Virginia) as the AWS Region.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * After you submit your request, Amazon Cognito requires up to 1 hour to distribute your new certificate to your
