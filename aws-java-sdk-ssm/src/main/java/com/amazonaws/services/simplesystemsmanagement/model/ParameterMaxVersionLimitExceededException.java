/**
 * <p>
 * Parameter Store retains the 100 most recently created versions of a parameter. After this number of versions has been
 * created, Parameter Store deletes the oldest version when a new one is created. However, if the oldest version has a
 * <i>label</i> attached to it, Parameter Store will not delete the version and instead presents this error message:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>An error occurred (ParameterMaxVersionLimitExceeded) when calling the PutParameter operation: You attempted to create a new version of <i>parameter-name</i> by calling the PutParameter API with the overwrite flag. Version <i>version-number</i>, the oldest version, can't be deleted because it has a label associated with it. Move the label to another version of the parameter, and try again.</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This safeguard is to prevent parameter versions with mission critical labels assigned to them from being deleted. To
 * continue creating new parameters, first move the label from the oldest version of the parameter to a newer one for
 * use in your operations. For information about moving parameter labels, see <a href=
 * "http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-labels.html#sysman-paramstore-labels-console-move"
