/**
 * Interface for accessing SSO.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.sso.AbstractAWSSSO} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Single Sign-On Portal is a web service that makes it easy for you to assign user access to AWS SSO resources such
 * as the user portal. Users can get AWS account applications and roles assigned to them and get federated into the
 * application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For general information about AWS SSO, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is AWS Single Sign-On?</a> in the
 * <i>AWS SSO User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO Portal operations that you can call programatically and includes
 * detailed information on data types and errors.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms, such as
 * Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, or Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS SSO and
 * other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.
