     * <li>
     * <p>
     * You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a
     * passphrase.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The private key must be no larger than 5 KB (5,120 bytes).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must enter its certificate chain.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The current time must be between the <code>Not Before</code> and <code>Not After</code> certificate fields.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The <code>Issuer</code> field must not be empty.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The OCSP authority URL, if present, must not exceed 1000 characters.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * To import a new certificate, omit the <code>CertificateArn</code> argument. Include this argument only when you
     * want to replace a previously imported certificate.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * When you import a certificate by using the CLI, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the
     * private key by their file names preceded by <code>fileb://</code>. For example, you can specify a certificate
     * saved in the <code>C:\temp</code> folder as <code>fileb://C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem</code>. If you are
     * making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these arguments as BLOBs.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the
     * private key files in the manner required by the programming language you're using.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The cryptographic algorithm of an imported certificate must match the algorithm of the signing CA. For example,
     * if the signing CA key type is RSA, then the certificate key type must also be RSA.
