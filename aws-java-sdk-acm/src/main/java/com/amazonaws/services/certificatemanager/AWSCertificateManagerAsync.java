     * passphrase.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must enter its certificate chain.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.

     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The current time must be between the <code>Not Before</code> and <code>Not After</code> certificate fields.
     * </p>
     * </li>

     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * When you import a certificate by using an SDK, you must specify the certificate, the certificate chain, and the

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
