/**
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * This is the latest version of the <b>AWS WAF</b> API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you
 * use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2",
 * to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number
 * of significant improvements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you used AWS WAF prior to this release, you can't use this AWS WAFV2 API to access any AWS WAF resources that you
 * created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other AWS WAF resources only through the AWS WAF Classic
 * APIs. The AWS WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For information, including how to migrate your AWS WAF resources to this version, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html">AWS WAF Developer Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * </note>
 * <p>
 * AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon
 * CloudFront, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AWS AppSync GraphQL API. AWS WAF also
 * lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests
 * originate from or the values of query strings, the API Gateway REST API, CloudFront distribution, the Application
 * Load Balancer, or the AWS AppSync GraphQL API responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP
 * 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is
 * blocked.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For
 * detailed information about AWS WAF features and an overview of how to use AWS WAF, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/">AWS WAF Developer Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can make calls using the endpoints listed in <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#waf_region">AWS Service Endpoints for AWS WAF</a>.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application
 * Load Balancer (ALB), an API Gateway REST API, or an AppSync GraphQL API.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * For AWS CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or
 * platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS SDKs</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * We currently provide two versions of the AWS WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic AWS WAF APIs. This
 * new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a
 * <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * You can define a Web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule
 * specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or Web ACL calls.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The limits AWS WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule
 * groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
