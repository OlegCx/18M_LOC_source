     * <li>

     * <code>DEFAULT</code> - Use the default firewall settings from the Lightsail instance blueprint. If this is

     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>INSTANCE</code> - Use the configured firewall settings from the source Lightsail instance. If this is
     * specified, the new instance that is created in Amazon EC2 will be configured to match the configuration of the
     * source Lightsail instance. For example, if the source instance is configured for dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6), then
     * IPv4 and IPv6 will be configured for the new instance that is created in Amazon EC2. If the source instance is
     * configured for IPv4 only, then only IPv4 will be configured for the new instance that is created in Amazon EC2.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>NONE</code> - Use the default Amazon EC2 security group. If this is specified, then only IPv4 will be
     * configured for the new instance that is created in Amazon EC2.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>CLOSED</code> - All ports closed. If this is specified, then only IPv4 will be configured for the new
     * instance that is created in Amazon EC2.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <note>
