/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint provides a set of operations (API). Your
 * conversational bot uses the runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For example,
 * suppose a user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex
 * recognizes that the user request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon
 * Lex engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size
 * and crust type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when you created the bot). You use the
 * build-time API to create and manage your Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time API,
 * .
