 * Amazon Lex provides both build and runtime endpoints. Each endpoint provides a set of operations (API). Your
 * conversational bot uses the runtime API to understand user utterances (user input text or voice). For example,
 * suppose a user says "I want pizza", your bot sends this input to Amazon Lex using the runtime API. Amazon Lex
 * recognizes that the user request is for the OrderPizza intent (one of the intents defined in the bot). Then Amazon
 * Lex engages in user conversation on behalf of the bot to elicit required information (slot values, such as pizza size
 * and crust type), and then performs fulfillment activity (that you configured when you created the bot). You use the
 * build-time API to create and manage your Amazon Lex bot. For a list of build-time operations, see the build-time API,
 * .

     * In response, Amazon Lex returns the next message to convey to the user. Consider the following example messages:

     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * For a user input "I would like a pizza," Amazon Lex might return a response with a message eliciting slot data

     * get user confirmation: "Order the pizza?".
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>

     * "Thank you, your cheese pizza has been ordered.".
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>

     * response. Some messages require only a yes or no response. In addition to the <code>message</code>, Amazon Lex
     * provides additional context about the message in the response that you can use to enhance client behavior, such
     * as displaying the appropriate client user interface. Consider the following examples:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
