/**
 * Interface for accessing AppConfig.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.appconfig.AbstractAmazonAppConfig} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS AppConfig</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Use AWS AppConfig, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, to create, manage, and quickly deploy application
 * configurations. AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes built-in
 * validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda,
 * containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple typo
 * could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check
 * to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration
 * data, you provide a schema or a Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration deployment or
 * update can only proceed when the configuration data is valid.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If
 * the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You
 * can configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including
 * velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig
 * automatically rolls back to the previous version.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested
 * with production traffic.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Feature toggle</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product
 * launch or announcement.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access paid content.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your application when a dependency or other external
 * factor impacts the system.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
