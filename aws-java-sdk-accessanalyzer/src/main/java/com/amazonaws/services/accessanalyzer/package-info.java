/**
 * <p>
 * AWS IAM Access Analyzer helps identify potential resource-access risks by enabling you to identify any policies that
 * grant access to an external principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies
 * in your AWS environment. An external principal can be another AWS account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a
 * federated user, an AWS service, or an anonymous user. You can also use Access Analyzer to preview and validate public
 * and cross-account access to your resources before deploying permissions changes. This guide describes the AWS IAM
 * Access Analyzer operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about Access Analyzer, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html">AWS IAM Access Analyzer</a> in
 * the <b>IAM User Guide</b>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To start using Access Analyzer, you first need to create an analyzer.
