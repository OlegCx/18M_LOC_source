/**
 * <p>
 * Provides the input image either as bytes or an S3 object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You pass image bytes to an Amazon Rekognition API operation by using the <code>Bytes</code> property. For example,
 * you would use the <code>Bytes</code> property to pass an image loaded from a local file system. Image bytes passed by
 * using the <code>Bytes</code> property must be base64-encoded. Your code may not need to encode image bytes if you are
 * using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition API operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information, see Analyzing an Image Loaded from a Local File System in the Amazon Rekognition Developer
 * Guide.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You pass images stored in an S3 bucket to an Amazon Rekognition API operation by using the <code>S3Object</code>
 * property. Images stored in an S3 bucket do not need to be base64-encoded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The region for the S3 bucket containing the S3 object must match the region you use for Amazon Rekognition
 * operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes using the Bytes property is not
 * supported. You must first upload the image to an Amazon S3 bucket and then call the operation using the S3Object
 * property.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For Amazon Rekognition to process an S3 object, the user must have permission to access the S3 object. For more
 * information, see Resource Based Policies in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
 * </p>
