/**
 * <p>
 * Identifies the bounding box around the label, face, text or personal protective equipment. The <code>left</code>
 * (x-coordinate) and <code>top</code> (y-coordinate) are coordinates representing the top and left sides of the
 * bounding box. Note that the upper-left corner of the image is the origin (0,0).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> values returned are ratios of the overall image size. For example, if the
 * input image is 700x200 pixels, and the top-left coordinate of the bounding box is 350x50 pixels, the API returns a
 * <code>left</code> value of 0.5 (350/700) and a <code>top</code> value of 0.25 (50/200).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> values represent the dimensions of the bounding box as a ratio of the
 * overall image dimension. For example, if the input image is 700x200 pixels, and the bounding box width is 70 pixels,
 * the width returned is 0.1.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * The bounding box coordinates can have negative values. For example, if Amazon Rekognition is able to detect a face
 * that is at the image edge and is only partially visible, the service can return coordinates that are outside the
 * image bounds and, depending on the image edge, you might get negative values or values greater than 1 for the
 * <code>left</code> or <code>top</code> values.
