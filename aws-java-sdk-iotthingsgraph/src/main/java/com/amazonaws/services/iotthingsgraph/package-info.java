 * <p>
 * AWS IoT Things Graph provides an integrated set of tools that enable developers to connect devices and services that
 * use different standards, such as units of measure and communication protocols. AWS IoT Things Graph makes it possible
 * to build IoT applications with little to no code by connecting devices and services and defining how they interact at
 * an abstract level.
 * </p>
