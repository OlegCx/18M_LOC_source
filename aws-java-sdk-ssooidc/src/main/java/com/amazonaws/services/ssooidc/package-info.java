/**
 * <p>
 * AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a client (such as AWS CLI or a native
 * application) to register with AWS SSO. The service also enables the client to fetch the userâ€™s access token upon
 * successful authentication and authorization with AWS SSO. This service conforms with the OAuth 2.0 based
 * implementation of the device authorization grant standard (<a
 * href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For general information about AWS SSO, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What is AWS Single Sign-On?</a> in the
 * <i>AWS SSO User Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This API reference guide describes the AWS SSO OIDC operations that you can call programatically and includes
 * detailed information on data types and errors.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms such as
 * Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS SSO and
 * other AWS services. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.
