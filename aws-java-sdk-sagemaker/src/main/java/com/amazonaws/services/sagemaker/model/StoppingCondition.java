/**
 * <p>
 * Specifies a limit to how long a model training or compilation job can run. It also specifies how long you are willing
 * to wait for a managed spot training job to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, Amazon SageMaker ends the
 * training or compilation job. Use this API to cap model training costs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To stop a job, Amazon SageMaker sends the algorithm the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal, which delays job termination for
 * 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts, so the results of training are
 * not lost.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The training algorithms provided by Amazon SageMaker automatically save the intermediate results of a model training
 * job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from
 * which it can be saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might not be ready to save. When saved,
 * this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to create a model with <code>CreateModel</code>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * The Neural Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model artifacts. When training NTMs, make
 * sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient for the training job to complete.
