 * notification when an asynchronous operation completes.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.marketplacecatalog.AbstractAWSMarketplaceCatalogAsync} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Catalog API actions allow you to manage your entities through list, describe, and update capabilities. An entity can
 * be a product or an offer on AWS Marketplace.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can automate your entity update process by integrating the AWS Marketplace Catalog API with your AWS Marketplace
 * product build or deployment pipelines. You can also create your own applications on top of the Catalog API to manage
 * your products on AWS Marketplace.
