/**
 * <p>
 * Represents a step adjustment for a <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_StepScalingPolicyConfiguration.html"
 * >StepScalingPolicyConfiguration</a>. Describes an adjustment based on the difference between the value of the
 * aggregated CloudWatch metric and the breach threshold that you've defined for the alarm.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm with a breach threshold of 50:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower bound of 0
 * and an upper bound of 10.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * To trigger the adjustment when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of
 * -10 and an upper bound of 0.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your step policy:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then
 * there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then
 * there must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The upper and lower bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
