 * <b>API Summary</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The Application Auto Scaling service API includes three key sets of actions:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Register and manage scalable targets - Register AWS or custom resources as scalable targets (a resource that
 * Application Auto Scaling can scale), set minimum and maximum capacity limits, and retrieve information on existing
 * scalable targets.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Configure and manage automatic scaling - Define scaling policies to dynamically scale your resources in response to
 * CloudWatch alarms, schedule one-time or recurring scaling actions, and retrieve your recent scaling activity history.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Suspend and resume scaling - Temporarily suspend and later resume automatic scaling by calling the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_RegisterScalableTarget.html"
 * >RegisterScalableTarget</a> API action for any Application Auto Scaling scalable target. You can suspend and resume
 * (individually or in combination) scale-out activities that are triggered by a scaling policy, scale-in activities
 * that are triggered by a scaling policy, and scheduled scaling.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * To learn more about Application Auto Scaling, including information about granting IAM users required permissions for
 * Application Auto Scaling actions, see the <a
