/**
 * Interface for accessing Amazon DevOps Guru.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.devopsguru.AbstractAmazonDevOpsGuru} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify anomalous behavior in business critical
 * operational applications. You specify the AWS resources that you want DevOps Guru to cover, then the Amazon
 * CloudWatch metrics and AWS CloudTrail events related to those resources are analyzed. When anomalous behavior is
 * detected, DevOps Guru creates an <i>insight</i> that includes recommendations, related events, and related metrics
 * that can help you improve your operational applications. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html">What is Amazon DevOps Guru</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple Notification Service topics so you are notified every time a new insight is
 * created. You can also enable DevOps Guru to generate an OpsItem in AWS Systems Manager for each insight to help you
 * manage and track your work addressing insights.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To learn about the DevOps Guru workflow, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html#how-it-works">How DevOps Guru works</a>.
 * To learn about DevOps Guru concepts, see <a
