You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>To assume a role from a different account, your AWS account must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account. </p> <p>A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have permissions that are delegated from the user account administrator. The administrator must attach a policy that allows the user to call <code>AssumeRole</code> for the ARN of the role in the other account. If the user is in the same account as the role, then you can do either of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Attach a policy to the user (identical to the previous user in a different account).</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this case, the trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based policy. Users in the same account as the role do not need explicit permission to assume the role.

This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an AWS MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters.

You can use Amazon Cognito with the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforios/\">AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</a> and the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforandroid/\">AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</a> to uniquely identify a user. You can also supply the user with a consistent identity throughout the lifetime of an application.</p> <p>To learn more about Amazon Cognito, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforandroid/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e840\">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in <i>AWS SDK for Android Developer Guide</i> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html#d0e664\">Amazon Cognito Overview</a> in the <i>AWS SDK for iOS Developer Guide</i>.</p> </note> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without including long-term AWS credentials in the application. You also don't need to deploy server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>The temporary security credentials returned by this API consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Applications can use these temporary security credentials to sign calls to AWS service API operations.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>By default, the temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> last for one hour. However, you can use the optional <code>DurationSeconds</code> parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html#id_roles_use_view-role-max-session\">View the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the <code>AssumeRole*</code> API operations or the <code>assume-role*</code> CLI commands. However the limit does not apply when you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html\">Using IAM Roles</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exception: you cannot call the STS <code>GetFederationToken</code> or <code>GetSessionToken</code> API operations.</p> <p>(Optional) You can pass inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policies</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent AWS API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your web identity token as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128 characters and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length\">IAM and STS Character Limits</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit. </p> </note> <p>You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached to the role. When you do, the session tag overrides the role tag with the same key.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role chaining. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html#id_session-tags_role-chaining\">Chaining Roles with Session Tags</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Identities</b> </p> <p>Before your application can call <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code>, you must have an identity token from a supported identity provider and create a role that the application can assume. The role that your application assumes must trust the identity provider that is associated with the identity token. In other words, the identity provider must be specified in the role's trust policy. </p> <important> <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> can result in an entry in your AWS CloudTrail logs. The entry includes the <a href=\"http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims\">Subject</a> of the provided web identity token. We recommend that you avoid using any personally identifiable information (PII) in this field. For example, you could instead use a GUID or a pairwise identifier, as <a href=\"http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SubjectIDTypes\">suggested in the OIDC specification</a>.</p> </important> <p>For more information about how to use web identity federation and the <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> API, see the following resources: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_oidc_manual.html\">Using Web Identity Federation API Operations for Mobile Apps</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_assumerolewithwebidentity\">Federation Through a Web-based Identity Provider</a>. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/the-aws-web-identity-federation-playground/\"> Web Identity Federation Playground</a>.
