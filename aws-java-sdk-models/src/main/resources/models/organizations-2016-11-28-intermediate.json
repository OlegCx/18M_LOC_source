The tags are attached to the commercial account associated with the GovCloud account, rather than the GovCloud account itself. To add tags to the GovCloud account, call the <a>TagResource</a> operation in the GovCloud Region after the new GovCloud account exists.</p> <p>You call this action from the management account of your organization in the commercial Region to create a standalone AWS account in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region. After the account is created, the management account of an organization in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region can invite it to that organization. For more information on inviting standalone accounts in the AWS GovCloud (US) to join an organization, see <a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/latest/UserGuide/govcloud-organizations.html\">AWS Organizations</a> in the <i>AWS GovCloud User Guide.</i> </p> <p>Calling <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because <code>CreateGovCloudAccount</code> operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the <code>OperationId</code> response element from this operation to provide as a parameter to the <a>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</a> operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Check the AWS CloudTrail log for the <code>CreateAccountResult</code> event.

The account in the commercial Region is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request. Both accounts are associated with the same email address.</p> <p>A role is created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An AWS GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the commercial account that you just created. A role is also created in the new AWS GovCloud (US) account that can be assumed by the AWS GovCloud (US) account that is associated with the management account of the commercial organization.

For example, accounts with India addresses must be associated with the AISPL marketplace. All accounts in an organization must be associated with the same marketplace.</p> </li> <li> <p>MASTER_ACCOUNT_MISSING_BUSINESS_LICENSE: Applies only to the AWS Regions in China.
