 * skills for your organization. Alexa for Business makes it efficient to voice-enable your products and services, thus
 * providing context-aware voice experiences for your customers. Device makers building with the Alexa Voice Service
 * (AVS) can create fully integrated solutions, register their products with Alexa for Business, and manage them as
 * shared devices in their organization.
