     * Region. The QuickSight console evaluates which customizations to apply by running this API operation with the
     * <code>Resolved</code> flag included.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To determine what customizations display when you run this command, it can help to visualize the relationship of
     * the entities involved.
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>AWS Account</code> - The AWS account exists at the top of the hierarchy. It has the potential to use all of
     * the AWS Regions and AWS Services. When you subscribe to QuickSight, you choose one AWS Region to use as your home
     * Region. That's where your free SPICE capacity is located. You can use QuickSight in any supported AWS Region.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>AWS Region</code> - In each AWS Region where you sign in to QuickSight at least once, QuickSight acts as a
     * separate instance of the same service. If you have a user directory, it resides in us-east-1, which is the US
     * East (N. Virginia). Generally speaking, these users have access to QuickSight in any AWS Region, unless they are
     * constrained to a namespace.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * To run the command in a different AWS Region, you change your Region settings. If you're using the AWS CLI, you
     * can use one of the following options:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-options.html">command line
     * options</a>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html">named profiles</a>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Run <code>aws configure</code> to change your default AWS Region. Use Enter to key the same settings for your
     * keys. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html">Configuring the AWS CLI</a>.

     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>Namespace</code> - A QuickSight namespace is a partition that contains users and assets (data sources,
     * datasets, dashboards, and so on). To access assets that are in a specific namespace, users and groups must also
     * be part of the same namespace. People who share a namespace are completely isolated from users and assets in
     * other namespaces, even if they are in the same AWS account and AWS Region.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>Applied customizations</code> - Within an AWS Region, a set of QuickSight customizations can apply to an
     * AWS account or to a namespace. Settings that you apply to a namespace override settings that you apply to an AWS
     * account. All settings are isolated to a single AWS Region. To apply them in other AWS Regions, run the
     * <code>CreateAccountCustomization</code> command in each AWS Region where you want to apply the same
     * customizations.
