/**
 * <p>
 * AWS App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to monitor and control microservices. App
 * Mesh standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high
 * availability for your applications.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every microservice in an application. You
 * can use App Mesh with AWS Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, Kubernetes on AWS, and Amazon EC2.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * App Mesh supports microservice applications that use service discovery naming for their components. For more
 * information about service discovery on Amazon ECS, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html">Service Discovery</a> in
 * the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. Kubernetes <code>kube-dns</code> and
 * <code>coredns</code> are supported. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/">DNS for Services and Pods</a> in the
 * Kubernetes documentation.
