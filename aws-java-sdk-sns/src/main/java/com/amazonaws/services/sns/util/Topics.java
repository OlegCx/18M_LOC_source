     * the queue to allow it to receive messages from the SNS topic.
     * <p>
     * The policy applied to the SQS queue is similar to this:
     * <pre>

     * moment, the new queue policy will propagate and the queue will be able to
     * receive messages. This delay only occurs immediately after initially
     * subscribing the queue.
