     * A list of session tags that you want to pass. Each session tag consists of a key name and an associated value.

     * <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This parameter is optional. You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys can’t exceed 128
     * characters, and the values can’t exceed 256 characters. For these and additional limits, see <a href=
     * "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-limits.html#reference_iam-limits-entity-length"
     * >IAM and STS Character Limits</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * An AWS conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a
     * separate limit. Your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The
     * <code>PackedPolicySize</code> response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your
     * request are to the upper size limit.
     * </p>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * You can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is already attached to the role. When you do, session
     * tags override a role tag with the same key.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate
     * <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the role has the
     * <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=
     * <code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as
     * separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the role tag.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Additionally, if you used temporary credentials to perform this operation, the new session inherits any
     * transitive session tags from the calling session. If you pass a session tag with the same key as an inherited
     * tag, the operation fails. To view the inherited tags for a session, see the AWS CloudTrail logs. For more
