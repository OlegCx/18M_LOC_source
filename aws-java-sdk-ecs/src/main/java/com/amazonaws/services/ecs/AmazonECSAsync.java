 * <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it
 * easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless
 * infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on AWS Fargate. For more control,
 * you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the
 * state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs,
 * isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster
 * management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind

     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html">Service Load
     * Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the
     * <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if
     * they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance that they're hosted on is reported as
     * healthy by the load balancer.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * There are two service scheduler strategies available:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>REPLICA</code> - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across
     * your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task
     * placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Service Scheduler
     * Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * <code>DAEMON</code> - The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance
     * that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. The service scheduler also
     * evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement
     * constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement
     * strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html">Service Scheduler
     * Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing
     * properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an <a>UpdateService</a>
     * operation. The default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 100%. The default
     * value for a daemon service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 0%.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower
     * limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment,
     * as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container
     * instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This
     * parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a
     * desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to
     * free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer
     * are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load
     * balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and they're reported as healthy by
     * the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the <b>maximum percent</b> parameter represents
     * an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or
     * <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to
     * the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service
     * contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For
     * example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler
     * may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do
     * this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If a service is using either the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types
     * and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the <b>minimum healthy percent</b> and <b>maximum percent</b> values are
     * used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the
     * <code>RUNNING</code> state while the container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state. If the tasks in
     * the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used,
     * although they're currently visible when describing your service.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When creating a service that uses the <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller, you can specify only
     * parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You
     * control your services using the <a>CreateTaskSet</a> operation. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-types.html">Amazon ECS Deployment
     * Types</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster using the following
     * logic:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for
     * example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although
     * you can choose a different placement strategy) with the <code>placementStrategy</code> parameter):
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Sort the valid container instances, giving priority to instances that have the fewest number of running tasks for
     * this service in their respective Availability Zone. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones
     * B and C each have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous
     * steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>

     * Updating the task placement strategies and constraints on an Amazon ECS service remains in preview and is a Beta
     * Service as defined by and subject to the Beta Service Participation Service Terms located at <a
     * href="https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms">https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms</a> ("Beta Terms"). These Beta
     * Terms apply to your participation in this preview.

     * <p>
     * Modifies the parameters of a service.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For services using the rolling update (<code>ECS</code>) deployment controller, the desired count, deployment
     * configuration, network configuration, task placement constraints and strategies, or task definition used can be
     * updated.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For services using the blue/green (<code>CODE_DEPLOY</code>) deployment controller, only the desired count,
     * deployment configuration, task placement constraints and strategies, and health check grace period can be updated
     * using this API. If the network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, a new AWS
     * CodeDeploy deployment should be created. For more information, see <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDeployment.html">CreateDeployment</a>
     * in the <i>AWS CodeDeploy API Reference</i>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For services using an external deployment controller, you can update only the desired count, task placement
     * constraints and strategies, and health check grace period using this API. If the launch type, load balancer,
     * network configuration, platform version, or task definition need to be updated, you should create a new task set.
     * For more information, see <a>CreateTaskSet</a>.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You can add to or subtract from the number of instantiations of a task definition in a service by specifying the
     * cluster that the service is running in and a new <code>desiredCount</code> parameter.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * If you have updated the Docker image of your application, you can create a new task definition with that image
     * and deploy it to your service. The service scheduler uses the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent
     * parameters (in the service's deployment configuration) to determine the deployment strategy.
     * </p>
     * <note>
     * <p>
     * If your updated Docker image uses the same tag as what is in the existing task definition for your service (for
     * example, <code>my_image:latest</code>), you do not need to create a new revision of your task definition. You can
     * update the service using the <code>forceNewDeployment</code> option. The new tasks launched by the deployment
     * pull the current image/tag combination from your repository when they start.
     * </p>
     * </note>
     * <p>
     * You can also update the deployment configuration of a service. When a deployment is triggered by updating the
     * task definition of a service, the service scheduler uses the deployment configuration parameters,
     * <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> and <code>maximumPercent</code>, to determine the deployment strategy.
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * If <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is below 100%, the scheduler can ignore <code>desiredCount</code>
     * temporarily during a deployment. For example, if <code>desiredCount</code> is four tasks, a minimum of 50% allows
     * the scheduler to stop two existing tasks before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that do not use a load
     * balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that use a load
     * balancer are considered healthy if they are in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance they are
     * hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * The <code>maximumPercent</code> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of running tasks during a
     * deployment, which enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if <code>desiredCount</code> is
     * four tasks, a maximum of 200% starts four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the
     * cluster resources required to do this are available).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * When <a>UpdateService</a> stops a task during a deployment, the equivalent of <code>docker stop</code> is issued
     * to the containers running in the task. This results in a <code>SIGTERM</code> and a 30-second timeout, after
     * which <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent and the containers are forcibly stopped. If the container handles the
     * <code>SIGTERM</code> gracefully and exits within 30 seconds from receiving it, no <code>SIGKILL</code> is sent.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * When the service scheduler launches new tasks, it determines task placement in your cluster with the following
     * logic:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Determine which of the container instances in your cluster can support your service's task definition (for
     * example, they have the required CPU, memory, ports, and container instance attributes).
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * By default, the service scheduler attempts to balance tasks across Availability Zones in this manner (although
     * you can choose a different placement strategy):
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Sort the valid container instances by the fewest number of running tasks for this service in the same
     * Availability Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each
     * have zero, valid container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for placement.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Place the new service task on a valid container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous
     * steps), favoring container instances with the fewest number of running tasks for this service.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * When the service scheduler stops running tasks, it attempts to maintain balance across the Availability Zones in
     * your cluster using the following logic:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Sort the container instances by the largest number of running tasks for this service in the same Availability
     * Zone as the instance. For example, if zone A has one running service task and zones B and C each have two,
     * container instances in either zone B or C are considered optimal for termination.
     * </p>
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * <p>
     * Stop the task on a container instance in an optimal Availability Zone (based on the previous steps), favoring
     * container instances with the largest number of running tasks for this service.
     * </p>
