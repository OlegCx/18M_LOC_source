 * Your Amazon ECS container instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to enable container

 * Container Agent</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. If you are using an Amazon
 * ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your instance needs at least version 1.26.0-1 of the <code>ecs-init</code> package. If your
 * container instances are launched from version <code>20190301</code> or later, then they contain the required versions
 * of the container agent and <code>ecs-init</code>. For more information, see <a

 * AMI</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.
