 * The log configuration for the container. This parameter maps to <code>LogConfig</code> in the <a
 * href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/#operation/ContainerCreate">Create a container</a> section of the <a
 * href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.35/">Docker Remote API</a> and the <code>--log-driver</code> option to <a
 * href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/"> <code>docker run</code> </a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses; however the container may use a
 * different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver configuration in the container definition.
 * For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see <a
 * href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/">Configure logging drivers</a> in the Docker
 * documentation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The following should be noted when specifying a log configuration for your containers:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the valid
 * values below). Additional log drivers may be available in future releases of the Amazon ECS container agent.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * This parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * For tasks hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, the Amazon ECS container agent must register the available logging drivers
 * with the <code>ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS</code> environment variable before containers placed on that instance
 * can use these log configuration options. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-config.html">Amazon ECS container agent
 * configuration</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * For tasks on AWS Fargate, because you do not have access to the underlying infrastructure your tasks are hosted on,
 * any additional software needed will have to be installed outside of the task. For example, the Fluentd output
 * aggregators or a remote host running Logstash to send Gelf logs to.
 * </p>
 * </li>
