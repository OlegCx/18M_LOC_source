/**
 * <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it
 * easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless
 * infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks on AWS Fargate. For more control,
 * you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API calls, allows you to get the
 * state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on your resource needs,
 * isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to operate your own cluster
 * management and configuration management systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.
 * </p>
