     * If the service is using the rolling update (<code>ECS</code>) deployment controller and using either an
     * Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer, you must specify one or more target group ARNs to attach to
     * the service. The service-linked role is required for services that make use of multiple target groups. For more

     * If the service is using the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> deployment controller, the service is required to use either
     * an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, you
     * specify two target groups (referred to as a <code>targetGroupPair</code>). During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy
     * determines which task set in your service has the status <code>PRIMARY</code> and associates one target group
     * with it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also
     * have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you
     * perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * After you create a service using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the load balancer name or target
     * group ARN, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using
