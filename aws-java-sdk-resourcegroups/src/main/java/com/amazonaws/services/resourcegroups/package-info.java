/**
 * <fullname>AWS Resource Groups</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS Resource Groups lets you organize AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Relational Database Service
 * databases, and Amazon S3 buckets into groups using criteria that you define as tags. A resource group is a collection
 * of resources that match the resource types specified in a query, and share one or more tags or portions of tags. You
 * can create a group of resources based on their roles in your cloud infrastructure, lifecycle stages, regions,
 * application layers, or virtually any criteria. Resource Groups enable you to automate management tasks, such as those
 * in AWS Systems Manager Automation documents, on tag-related resources in AWS Systems Manager. Groups of tagged
 * resources also let you quickly view a custom console in AWS Systems Manager that shows AWS Config compliance and
 * other monitoring data about member resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To create a resource group, build a resource query, and specify tags that identify the criteria that members of the
 * group have in common. Tags are key-value pairs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For more information about Resource Groups, see the <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html">AWS Resource Groups User Guide</a>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS Resource Groups uses a REST-compliant API that you can use to perform the following types of operations.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on resource groups and resource query entities

 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Applying, editing, and removing tags from resource groups
