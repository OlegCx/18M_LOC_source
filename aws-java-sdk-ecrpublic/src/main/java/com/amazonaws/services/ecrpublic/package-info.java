 * Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry service. Amazon ECR provides
 * both public and private registries to host your container images. You can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their
 * preferred client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure, scalable, and reliable registry for
 * your Docker or Open Container Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports public repositories with this API. For
 * information about the Amazon ECR API for private repositories, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon Elastic Container Registry API
 * Reference</a>.
