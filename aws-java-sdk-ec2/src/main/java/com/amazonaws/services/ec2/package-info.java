/**
 * <fullname>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides secure and resizable computing capacity in the AWS Cloud. Using
 * Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster.
 * Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud
 * where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you've defined. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
 * provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes are highly available and reliable
 * storage volumes that can be attached to any running instance and used like a hard drive.
