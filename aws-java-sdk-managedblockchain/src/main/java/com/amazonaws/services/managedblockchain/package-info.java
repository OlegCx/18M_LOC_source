/**
 * <p/>
 * <p>
 * Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating and managing blockchain networks using open-source
 * frameworks. Blockchain allows you to build applications where multiple parties can securely and transparently run
 * transactions and share data without the need for a trusted, central authority.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Managed Blockchain supports the Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum open-source frameworks. Because of fundamental
 * differences between the frameworks, some API actions or data types may only apply in the context of one framework and
 * not the other. For example, actions related to Hyperledger Fabric network members such as <code>CreateMember</code>
 * and <code>DeleteMember</code> do not apply to Ethereum.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The description for each action indicates the framework or frameworks to which it applies. Data types and properties
 * that apply only in the context of a particular framework are similarly indicated.
 * </p>
