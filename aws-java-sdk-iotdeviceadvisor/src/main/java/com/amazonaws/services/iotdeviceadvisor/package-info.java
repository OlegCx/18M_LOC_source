 * AWS IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully managed test capability for validating IoT devices during device
 * software development. Device Advisor provides pre-built tests that you can use to validate IoT devices for reliable
 * and secure connectivity with AWS IoT Core before deploying devices to production. By using Device Advisor, you can
 * confirm that your devices can connect to AWS IoT Core, follow security best practices and, if applicable, receive
 * software updates from IoT Device Management. You can also download signed qualification reports to submit to the AWS
 * Partner Network to get your device qualified for the AWS Partner Device Catalog without the need to send your device
 * in and wait for it to be tested.
