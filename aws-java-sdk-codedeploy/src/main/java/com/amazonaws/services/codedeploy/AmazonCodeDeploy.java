/**
 * Interface for accessing CodeDeploy.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.codedeploy.AbstractAmazonCodeDeploy} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS CodeDeploy</fullname>
 * <p>
 * AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises
 * instances running in your own facility, serverless AWS Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon ECS service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated Lambda function, updated
 * applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia
 * files, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or
 * Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes to your existing code before you can use AWS CodeDeploy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application
 * deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with
 * error-prone manual deployments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>AWS CodeDeploy Components</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following AWS CodeDeploy components:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Application</b>: A name that uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. AWS CodeDeploy uses this
 * name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and
 * deployment group are referenced during a deployment.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Deployment group</b>: A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment configuration settings, or an
 * Amazon ECS service and network details. A Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of
 * a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load
 * balancer, and a listener to reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An EC2/On-premises
 * deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or
 * both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and rollback settings.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Deployment configuration</b>: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by AWS
 * CodeDeploy during a deployment.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Deployment</b>: The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a containerized application
 * in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing content on one or more instances.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * <b>Application revisions</b>: For an AWS Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Lambda
 * function to be updated and one or more functions to validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS
 * deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition, container, and port where
 * production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source
 * content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are
 * stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3
 * object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in your deployments, to make
 * on-premises instances available for AWS CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment,
 * and to get details about Amazon ECS service deployments.
