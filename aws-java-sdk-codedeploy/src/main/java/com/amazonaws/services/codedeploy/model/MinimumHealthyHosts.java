     *        <p>

     *        In an example of nine instances, if a HOST_COUNT of six is specified, deploy to up to three instances at a
     *        time. The deployment is successful if six or more instances are deployed to successfully. Otherwise, the
     *        deployment fails. If a FLEET_PERCENT of 40 is specified, deploy to up to five instances at a time. The
     *        deployment is successful if four or more instances are deployed to successfully. Otherwise, the deployment
     *        fails.

     *        <p>
     *        In a call to the <code>GetDeploymentConfig</code>, CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime returns a minimum healthy
     *        instance type of MOST_CONCURRENCY and a value of 1. This means a deployment to only one instance at a
     *        time. (You cannot set the type to MOST_CONCURRENCY, only to HOST_COUNT or FLEET_PERCENT.) In addition,
     *        with CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime, AWS CodeDeploy attempts to ensure that all instances but one are kept
