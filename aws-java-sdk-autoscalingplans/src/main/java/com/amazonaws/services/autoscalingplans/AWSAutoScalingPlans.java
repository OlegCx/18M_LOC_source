/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS Auto Scaling Plans.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.autoscalingplans.AbstractAWSAutoScalingPlans} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS Auto Scaling</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Use AWS Auto Scaling to create scaling plans for your applications to automatically scale your scalable AWS
 * resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>API Summary</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can use the AWS Auto Scaling service API to accomplish the following tasks:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Create and manage scaling plans
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Define target tracking scaling policies to dynamically scale your resources based on utilization
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Scale Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups using predictive scaling and dynamic scaling to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity
 * faster
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Set minimum and maximum capacity limits
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Retrieve information on existing scaling plans
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Access current forecast data and historical forecast data for up to 56 days previous
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * To learn more about AWS Auto Scaling, including information about granting IAM users required permissions for AWS
 * Auto Scaling actions, see the <a
