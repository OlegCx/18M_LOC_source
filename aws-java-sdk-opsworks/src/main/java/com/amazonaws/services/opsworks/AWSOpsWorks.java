/**
 * Interface for accessing AWS OpsWorks.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Do not directly implement this interface, new methods are added to it regularly. Extend from
 * {@link com.amazonaws.services.opsworks.AbstractAWSOpsWorks} instead.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <fullname>AWS OpsWorks</fullname>
 * <p>
 * Welcome to the <i>AWS OpsWorks Stacks API Reference</i>. This guide provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples
 * for AWS OpsWorks Stacks actions and data types, including common parameters and error codes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS OpsWorks Stacks is an application management service that provides an integrated experience for overseeing the
 * complete application lifecycle. For information about this product, go to the <a
 * href="http://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/">AWS OpsWorks</a> details page.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>SDKs and CLI</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The most common way to use the AWS OpsWorks Stacks API is by using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or by using
 * one of the AWS SDKs to implement applications in your preferred language. For more information, see:

 * <b>Endpoints</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * AWS OpsWorks Stacks supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints.
 * Stacks can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>

 * <b>Chef Versions</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you call <a>CreateStack</a>, <a>CloneStack</a>, or <a>UpdateStack</a> we recommend you use the
 * <code>ConfigurationManager</code> parameter to specify the Chef version. The recommended and default value for Linux
 * stacks is currently 12. Windows stacks use Chef 12.2. For more information, see <a
 * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingcookbook-chef11.html">Chef Versions</a>.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * You can specify Chef 12, 11.10, or 11.4 for your Linux stack. We recommend migrating your existing Linux stacks to
 * Chef 12 as soon as possible.
