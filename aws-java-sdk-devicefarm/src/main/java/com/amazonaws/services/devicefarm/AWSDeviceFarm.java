 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Testing on desktop browsers
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Device Farm makes it possible for you to test your web applications on desktop browsers using Selenium. The APIs for

 * Farm</a>.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Testing on real mobile devices
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Device Farm makes it possible for you to test apps on physical phones, tablets, and other devices in the cloud. For
 * more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/">Device Farm
