/**
 * <p>
 * The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and enterprises to quickly find and deploy
 * serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. For more information about serverless applications, see Serverless
 * Computing and Applications on the AWS website.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console, so that developers of all
 * levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category keywords
 * to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots. You can also
 * search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it, configure
 * any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately within your
 * team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the AWS Management
 * Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the code, you upload a
 * simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template. For more information
 * about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs GitHub repository.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more information about the two developer
 * experiences available:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * Consuming Applications – Browse for applications and view information about them, including source code and readme
 * files. Also install, configure, and deploy applications of your choosing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Publishing Applications – Configure and upload applications to make them available to other developers, and publish
 * new versions of applications.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
