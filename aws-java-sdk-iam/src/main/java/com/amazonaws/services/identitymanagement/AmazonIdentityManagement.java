     * <b>Access control</b> - Include tags in IAM user-based and resource-based policies. You can use tags to restrict
     * access to only an IAM requesting user that has a specified tag attached. You can also restrict access to only
     * those resources that have a certain tag attached. For examples of policies that show how to use tags to control
     * access, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html">Control access using IAM
